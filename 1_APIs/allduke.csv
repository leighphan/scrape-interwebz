Sound Portraits Influenced By the View From the Train,2005-02-26,"When jazz bands played one-nighters in long lists of fourth-tier American towns, trains were a major part of their logistical life. But trains naturally crept into jazz composers' aesthetic lives, too. At least, this was the case with Duke Ellington, who worked so much about the outside world into his music. The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra has seized on the train theme in jazz before, most memorably in a 1990 concert of Ellington music that included a little train-related sequence. On Thursday night, the band played an entire program of train music titled ''Full Steam Ahead'' and heavily tilted toward the music of Ellington and its leader, Wynton Marsalis. (The exceptions were Hall Overton's big-band orchestration of Thelonious Monk's ''Little Rootie Tootie'' and a showy, upbeat piece by Wycliffe Gordon, ''West End Choo-Choo,'' with the young singer Jennifer Sanon.)",4fd2839e8eb7c8105d851e29,533
The Listings; LESTER YOUNG,2005-03-11,"Since 1965, jazz and religion have formed a literal crossroads at the Jazz Ministry of St. Peter's Lutheran Church, in Midtown Manhattan. The Rev. John Garcia Gensel, a great friend to musicians including Duke Ellington, started the ministry; at his death in 1998, he was succeeded by the Rev. Dale Lind. The jazz ministry serves its Samaritan function, but it is also a sort of social hub, and one of the hidden forces that holds the large community of jazz musicians together in New York. Aside from Sunday-evening jazz vespers, memorial services for departed jazz musicians and other regular events, the jazz ministry holds an annual fund-raiser centering on the legacy of Lester Young, above, a musician who will never pass out of favor. The 21st edition of ''To Prez With Love'' happens on Sunday evening, with an impressive lineup of musicians (and storytellers) spanning three generations, including Don Byron, Lou Donaldson, Junior Mance, Connie Crothers, Ron Blake, Gene Bertoncini, the radio host Phil Schaap and many others.

GEOFFREY KEEZER TRIO,2005-10-14,"The pianist Geoffrey Keezer has been pegged as a dexterous hard-bopper since the late-1980's, when he held a prestigious post with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers while still underage. Mr. Keezer, above, hasn't disavowed those first impressions, but his career has recently expanded to match the breadth of his interests. As a member of the Christian McBride Band, Mr. Keezer plays electric keyboards in a setting perhaps best described as postfusion; he has lately been doing a smoother version of the same thing with David Sanborn. In 2003 he released an ambitious solo album that notably featured the Hawaiian slack-key-guitar master Keola Beamer; this summer he teamed up with another guitar legend, Jim Hall, for a forthcoming album of duets. Mr. Keezer's latest effort as a leader, ''Wildcrafted'' (MaxJazz), documents his trio at the Dakota Jazz Club in Minneapolis last year. The album's originals range from somber classicism (''Ghost in the Photograph'') to kinetic soul (''Mirrim''); each setting effectively showcases Mr. Keezer's piano playing, which weds prodigious technique to a disarmingly earnest lyricism. The choice of covers is just as telling: Mr. Keezer recasts signature standards by Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington; ''Venus as a Boy'' by Bjork and ''Koikugari Bushi'' by the Okinawan folksinger Sadao China. It would all sound like a hodgepodge if not for Mr. Keezer's easy but focused rapport with his rhythm-mates, and especially with the drummer Terreon Gully. (Matt Clohesy plays bass on the album; Mike Pope will appear here.) This week's Village Vanguard run should help earn the group its due as one of the sharper contemporary piano trios on the scene. (Tuesday through Oct. 23 at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tomorrow, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.)

"Arts, Briefly; Strawberry Field No More",2005-01-18,"The Salvation Army plans to close Strawberry Field, above, the children's home that inspired John Lennon to write the Beatles classic ''Strawberry Fields Forever'' in 1966. The institution, near Lennon's home in Liverpool, England, was opened in 1936 and became a tourist attraction for Beatles fans. ''Strawberry Field has served children and young people well over the years in providing accommodation and support for the future,'' said Maj. Marion Drew, the divisional leader of the Salvation Army in northwest England, ''but care for young people has moved on significantly, and we are responding to that change.'' In 1984, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, donated $120,000 to keep the home open, and members of the British Beatles Fan Club have asked her to intervene to save it from closing, a step scheduled for May 2007. MARION UNDERHILL Footnotes Elvis Presley is on the top of the British pop charts for the second week in a row with a reissue of his 1959 hit ''One Night.'' It is the 1,000th song to be a No. 1 on the chart, which began in 1952. Last week a reissue of ''Jailhouse Rock'' held that place. Throughout the 1980's and 90's the trombonist Ed Neumeister was a busy jazz musician in New York, playing with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra and Duke Ellington Orchestra, among others. In 1999 he moved to Austria, where he teaches at the University of Music in Graz, as well as at the Music Conservatory in Lucerne, Switzerland. Tonight he returns to the Jazz Standard to celebrate the release of his latest CD, ''New Standards,'' released on his own MeisteroMusic label. The 13th annual Outsider Art Fair is to take place at the Puck Building, at Houston and Lafayette Streets in SoHo, from Jan. 28 to 30 after a preview on Jan. 27.",4fd24a478eb7c8105d7e7ff7,300
The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; VIJAY IYER,2005-06-17,"He appeared about 10 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area, a very young jazz pianist bursting with micro- and macro- and meta-theories. He wanted to unite jazz and funk, Indian drone elements and swing; he also seemed to want to synthesize four pianists, related but still diverse: Duke Ellington, Andrew Hill, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor. (There were urgent political themes, too, addressed in liner notes.) His music was usually based in odd meters and played hard and dry; it could be daunting. He wasn't working in a vacuum, though, and kept sanding down his sound. Some of his most important early colleagues, like the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa and the guitarist Liberty Ellman, ended up in New York around the same time that he did, in 1998; then the circle expanded again, bringing in the drummer Derrek Phillips and the bassist Stephan Crump. Now Mr. Iyer, above, leads a quartet that includes Mr. Mahanthappa, Mr. Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, who is only 19 but has the potential to become one of the bulldozing presences in New York jazz. The band's most recent album, ''Reimagining'' (Savoy Jazz), is its best, and Mr. Iyer's gigs are attaining a newly urgent momentum, with some genuine lyricism offsetting the rhythm attack. He's a jazz musician of the moment, and now's the time to hear him. (Tuesday through Thursday at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; sets are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., and the cover charge is $20.)

Characteristically, Ms. McPartland played the line not for sympathy but for laughs. Then she turned to the piano and began a solo performance that cast all thoughts of frailty aside.

A Choreographer Employs Past Ballets as Prologue,2005-06-16,"Pascal Rioult doesn't make dances as much as remake them, using famous works and their scores as his points of departure. In his latest program, seen Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, Mr. Rioult takes on Stravinsky: ''Les Noces'' is a modernized marriage ritual, while ''Firebird'' (2003) is an earnest exploration of good and evil in which a bird -- portrayed by a young girl -- transports a group of jaded souls to a place of innocence and rebirth. The premiere of ''Les Noces,'' a portrait of sexual discovery, was blessedly the less preachy of the two. Just as Bronislava Nijinska did in 1923 with her original seminal ballet about a Russian peasant wedding, Mr. Rioult explores a marriage rite. In his version, there isn't one bride and groom, but four of each, trapped between desire and a fear of commitment.",4fd284b88eb7c8105d8540e5,365
Keepers Of the Flame Pay Tribute To an Original,2005-11-16,"If any cabaret entertainer could be named the artistic heir to the irreplaceable Bobby Short, the most likely candidate is probably Michael Feinstein, the singer, pianist and musical archivist, who is so busy he sometimes seems to be performing on several New York stages at once. Fundamental differences make that lineage far from obvious. Mr. Short, who died in March, was African-American, and Mr. Feinstein is Jewish.

An Ace in the Hole,2005-12-03,"PERHAPS more than most people, I was shocked by the news this week about Representative Randy Cunningham of California. For me, it wasn't just about being disappointed in a man who accepted among other things a Rolls-Royce, Persian rugs, a lavish graduation party for his daughter and a yacht in exchange for political favors; it was much deeper. For me, it was about not just the fall but the complete and utter collapse of my hero. From my perspective, Randy Cunningham, known universally as Duke, wasn't really a Congressman from California -- he was a naval aviator, a decorated Vietnam veteran, winner of the Navy Cross. He flew the F-4 Phantom fighter jet and shot down five enemy aircraft during the war. Those five downed jets made him an ace -- a term that hummed with coolness. Eddie Rickenbacker was an ace. Chuck Yeager was an ace. Snoopy was an ace.",4fd24fd28eb7c8105d7f28ae,980
The Musical Odyssey of Min Xiao-Fen,2005-03-03,"In his well-known Norton lectures at Harvard in 1973, ''The Unanswered Question,'' Leonard Bernstein asked, ''Whither music in our time?'' The influences of Schoenberg and Stravinsky were duly pondered; the question remained unanswered. Today, at the beginning of the 21st century, the answer is all around us. The future is global. Non-European and popular music, not 12-tone rows and Neo-Classicism, are what have refreshed and expanded the musical traditions Bernstein held dear. Composers like Steve Reich, Philip Glass and John Adams, none of whom can be called classical musicians, are one part of ''postclassical'' music.

"Paid Notice: Deaths   BURDICK, RICHARD",2005-03-27,"BURDICK--Richard. A great loss is felt by our family and his many friends at the passing of Richard Smith Burdick, 88, on March 17, 2005 in Austin, Texas. He was predeceased by his wife of 54 years, Betty. He leaves his beloved fiance, Sherry Browne. He was the loving Father of Dorene and Bruce Burdick, and of daughter-inlaw Gwenellen; proud grandfather of Surya, Michelle, Orion, Douglass, and Melissa, and great-grandfather of Riley, Wolfie, Jake, and Amelie. He is also survived by his adored sister, Loyce and his close cousins, the Smiths: Penny, Ron, and Pat; and by the Coons cousins. Richard Burdick was born in Pittsfield, Mass. in 1916 among his treasured Berkshire Hills. A magician and writer even as a boy, he spent his stint in the Army as cowriter of This Is the Army with Irving Berlin. During that time he also wrote many stage musicals, radio dramas, and short stories. In the lifetime of a multifaceted career -writer, producer, actor, director, composer-lyricist, magician, and broadcasting executive -he enjoyed singular encounters with a mosaic of celebrated people: Ethel Barrymore, Mae West, Max Baer, Joe Louis, Tallulah Bankhead, Jimmy Durante, Gary Merrill, Helen Hayes, Kay Kyser, Dinah Shore, Duke Ellington, Dr. Dinton Cooley, Eleanor Roosevelt, President Truman, Reverend Billy Graham, and Dr. Timothy Johnson. Richard Burdick was a visionary pioneer in public broadcasting. He was a theatrical director and operations manager in early radio and he helped launch one of the first educational TV stations in the country -WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill, N.C. Following this, he was managing director at the public TV station WHYY in Philadelphia, always contributing original scripts. He was on the founding management team of WCVB , one of the top-rated TV stations in Boston which produced great quality, quantity, and diversity of local programming, and which the NY Times called the finest commercial TV station in America. He became a board member, contributing playwright ( of eleven plays), and supporter of Florida Studio Theater in Sarasota, Florida and also was cherished by other theatres including Shakespeare & Co. in Lenox, Mass. where he was a Founding Trustee member and where he contributed three plays. Richard had a talent for living, an unflagging and exceptional creative drive, and a generosity of spirit and mind that was highly motivating to his family, friends and associates. In his autobiography entitled: Next Time I Want To Come Back As a Yellow Bird, he opens with his usual flourish and excitement, asking ''Do you believe in magic?'' and he clearly did delight in Life's great mystery and drama; and always with his unique, Burdick wit. He closed the book with this comment: '' ...as the river of Life continues its eternal flow, my personal tributary will rejoin it on its way back to the source.'' A memorial gathering will take place in May in his home town of Pittsfield, Mass., details to be finalized soon.

"Arts, Briefly",2005-02-08,"More Marley in Africa? Will a tribute to Bob Marley become an annual event in Africa? Could be, was the answer yesterday from organizers of the concert that drew an estimated 200,000 people to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, on Sundayto celebrate the 60th anniversary of the birth of Marley, the Jamaican reggae star who died in 1981. Flanked by Lauryn Hill, left, and Angélique Kidjo, who performed at the tribute, Desta Meghoo-Peddie, the director of the Bob Marley Foundation, said at a news conference in Addis Ababa, ''It's our hope that we're taking this concert to a different African country, and that's the plan on the drawing board,'' Reuters reported. U2, Feeling Sorry The U2 drummer Larry Mullen, below, has posted a letter on the band's Web site offering refunds to members of its subscription service who had hoped to buy tickets for its American tour. They were to have the first chance to buy tickets, but the opportunity didn't work as planned. ''The idea that our longtime U2 fans and scalpers competed for U2 tickets through our own Web site is appalling to me,'' Mr. Mullen wrote. The coast-to-coast tour is to bring the band to the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on May 17 and 18 and to Madison Square Garden on May 21. Rehabilitating Macbeth Did Shakespeare, below, defame Macbeth? Yes, says a group of members of the Scottish Parliament, Reuters reported. On the occasion of the 1,000th anniversary of the birth of Macbeth, the Scottish king who reigned from 1040 to 1057, the legislators are seeking to restore his reputation, blackened by Shakespeare's 400-year-old tragedy, which portrays him as a murderer tormented by the prophesies of witches who is eventually reduced to madness before being killed himself. ''He was perceived as a good king who stabilized the country and has since been maligned by Shakespeare's play,'' said Alex Johnstone, one of the group seeking a commemoration of Macbeth's birth. ''In a time of war, he unified the country and promoted Christianity.'' He said Shakespeare wrote to play to appeal to King James VI, who, he said, believed in witches.

Mr. Nash appeared to be a jazz traditionalist, a saxophonist of great dexterity and refinement in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, one of the crew who spent much of their working lives finessing Ellington, Basie and the rest of what you might call the jazz canon. Stereotypes are always worth squashing. Jazz musicians should never be read by their covers: inside every musician who seems a hardcore bebopper or avant-gardist or whatever, there are dozens of interests at play.

This Trombonist Doesn't Need a Lot of Notes,2005-10-06,"Delfeayo Marsalis began his six-night run at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola on Tuesday with something he introduced as ''one of the greatest tunes ever written.'' It was ''C-Jam Blues,'' from the Duke Ellington songbook: a laconic riff piece, based on a single interval. It's a masterwork, Mr. Marsalis explained, ''because it uses the least amount of notes of any song.'' That playfully reductive philosophy goes a long way toward explaining Mr. Marsalis, a first-rate trombonist with a bewilderingly low-key solo career. For 20 years, he has worked extensively as a producer and sideman with artists like the drummer Elvin Jones, the singer Ruth Brown and every musical member of his family. But in all that time, he has issued only two albums as a leader, the last one nearly a decade ago.

A Little Nostalgia and a Lot of Unruly Trombone,2005-11-22,"The big, braying sound of Roswell Rudd's trombone has been a prominent feature of jazz's avant-garde landscape for more than 40 years. It still has a way of turning up in strange places: Mr. Rudd's latest album, ''Blue Mongol'' (Sunnyside), puts him in touch with Buryat throat singers from Mongolia. On Sunday afternoon at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, he went for something more familiar -- although, in a way, almost as uncommon. For a celebration of his 70th birthday, he reunited with Eli's Chosen Six, the Dixieland band from his student days at Yale. A boisterous bunch of white revivalists, Eli's Chosen Six had its hot minute in the mid-1950's, when ''college jazz'' suggested a catchphrase rather than a curriculum. With the help of the producer and Yale alumnus George Avakian, the band recorded an album for Columbia Records in 1955, and it appeared a few years later in the film ''Jazz on a Summer's Day.'' (Mr. Rudd missed the shoot, which would have involved zipping around Newport, R.I., in a convertible jalopy.)

The Song of Himself,2005-03-27,"''DON'T you look grand!'' Bobby Short shouted from behind the piano at the Café Carlyle this past December. The packed, cheering house of 100 looked grand indeed on a weeknight, with a $95 cover charge. After his 36 seasons in that room, people were anything but tired of the 80-year-old grandfather of cabaret. Mr. Short's cane was stashed away near the bar; under the spotlight, he showed no signs of the neuropathy that had left him with wobbly, aching legs. As for a singing voice worn down by 60 years of saloon work, he blustered through the gravel with such gusto that a New York Times headline of 2001 called him ''ageless as springtime.''",4fd283a78eb7c8105d85224a,1236

Eminent Disdain,2005-07-09,"WITH all the debate over who will replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, one of the most shocking Supreme Court decisions in recent history has disappeared from the headlines. And that's a shame because it's a ruling that has huge implications for urban communities. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court last month cleared the way for the City of New London, Conn., to proceed with a plan to replace a faded residential waterfront neighborhood with office space, a hotel, a conference center and luxury apartments. Now the holdout owners of 11 residential properties will have to join the dozens of owners of houses and stores in the 90-acre neighborhood who have already fled. Two cafes, a deli, an auto body shop, a lobster business and a church have been closed.",4fd284ba8eb7c8105d8542c9,826
Sometimes a Soundtrack Is Just a Soundtrack,2005-06-05,"THE English composer Benedict Mason says he would like to hear the music of his ''ChaplinOperas'' all by itself, free and clear of the three Charlie Chaplin films for which it made such a charming partner at the Rose Theater recently. I don't think I would. Mr. Mason's raucous polyglot of instruments, song and narration served the moving image with precision, his skill at lining up eye movement with ear movement a wonder of applied art all in itself. Yet the music of ''ChaplinOperas'' ends up as one more active mechanism in a larger machine. Music like this, removed and isolated, is like a car motor unhooked from its crankshaft. The pistons go up and down very nicely, but we are not being taken anywhere.",4fd248728eb7c8105d7e4c64,868
"Where Lady Day Sleeps, A Jazz Tradition Awakes",2005-03-13,"In an empty room in Harlem, there is a 57-year-old mural of four men playing jazz and a woman face-down on a bed. The man on guitar is Charlie Christian, it is said, the virtuoso who learned to pick and strum almost before he learned to walk. The man on clarinet is Tony Scott, who helped bring be-bop to the woodwinds. No one is quite sure who is playing the whisk drums, but the trumpeter is almost certainly Hot Lips Page, the masterly Texas sideman. As for the woman, the story goes that it is Billie Holiday, sleeping off a drunk.",4fd246038eb7c8105d7e0c69,774

A Monday-Night Institution Stages a Weeklong Bash,2005-05-10,"Forty years ago, an important jazz group started with a rejection. In 1965, Count Basie turned down a sheaf of arrangements written for him by Thad Jones, the great trumpeter, who was in his big band. They were too far afield from the Basie band's customary style. Jones responded by rehearsing 18 musicians to play them, asking the drummer Mel Lewis to be co-pilot. It was to be a part-time band, a release valve for studio-bound musicians. Jazz clubs were generally closed on Monday nights, but Max Gordon, owner of the Village Vanguard, opened his club for them to perform on Feb. 7, 1966, and promised the following Monday as well.",4fd2a6588eb7c8105d88eb33,814
A Life Led On Jazz Standard Time,2005-02-06,"IT seems fitting, really, that the jazz pianist Bill Charlap, widely considered to be one of the foremost interpreters of the classic American popular song (think Gershwin, Porter, Berlin), should live in an elegant old brick apartment building in Summit, with ivy creeping up the walls and a gaslight glowing in the courtyard. Inside Mr. Charlap's apartment, hundreds of CD's and albums -- carefully alphabetized and categorized -- line every available space on the walls. A stately black Steinway dominates the living room, where the bookshelf's titles range from Dizzy Gillespie's ''To Be or Not to Bop'' to a biography of Gershwin. The sleek audio system fills the room with the urgent music of the tormented but brilliant jazz pianist Bud Powell.",4fd2571a8eb7c8105d80125f,754
"At Historic Apollo Theater, Restored Facade Is the Star of the Day",2005-12-15,"Like any 92-year-old, the Apollo Theater has been alternately cherished and neglected. There was one moment when the theater was scheduled for demolition, then one when it was declared a historic landmark. But through it all, the Apollo, a 1913 former burlesque hall designed by George Keister, has stood on West 125th Street as a beacon of black entertainment, an aging Harlem icon. Now, the distinctive yellow-and-red blade sign out front beckons once again. Today, a restoration of the Apollo's regal terra-cotta facade is to be unveiled. The marquee has been modernized with light-emitting diodes meant to resemble as much as possible the original hand-applied letters. The theater's storefront has been updated in the spirit of a 1930's design, with a semicircular box office of stainless steel. Flat screen monitors built into the storefront have replaced the original poster cases.",4fd262fb8eb7c8105d814f6f,930

"Arts, Briefly",2005-10-25,"Rapper Recovering From Shooting The rapper Cam'ron was recovering at home in Harlem yesterday, having been shot in both arms early Sunday, The Associated Press reported. The shooting occurred when someone apparently tried to carjack his Lamborghini after he left a nightclub in Washington. ''People are foolish if they think I'm going to lose my head and give up anything to anyone just because someone threatens me,'' Cam'ron, 29, right, said in a statement yesterday. ''I'm doing O.K. It takes more than a botched carjacking to keep me down.'' Lynn Hobson, a spokeswoman for Diplomat Records, Cam'ron's label, said a single shot had passed through both of his arms. He was treated at Howard University Hospital and released on Sunday afternoon. His next album, ''Killa Season,'' is to be issued in February. Newark Boy Makes Good Newark has a new street sign as well as a plaque on the home where Philip Roth, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''American Pastoral'' and other novels, grew up, The Associated Press reported. Not only was Mr. Roth on hand for the ceremony on Sunday, but so was Mayor Sharpe James, along with 75 Roth fans on a bus tour of Newark sites featured in his books. Mr. Roth, 72, lived in the home in the Weequahic neighborhood from 1933 to 1942. At the Weequahic Branch Library, in comments reported by The Star-Ledger of Newark, Mr. Roth referred to the Nobel Prize ceremony when he said, ''Today, Newark is my Stockholm, and that plaque is my prize.'' Chief Ousted At Screen Actors Guild After only six months on the job, Greg Hessinger, below, has been dismissed as national executive director and chief executive of the Screen Actors Guild, The Associated Press reported. The decision by the board of the 100,000-member union was announced by its president, Alan Rosenberg, who represents a faction that opposes a merger with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The union rejected the merger two years ago. Mr. Hessinger, hired by the previous president, Melissa Gilbert, supported the merger. Peter Frank, the union's chief financial officer, was named interim successor to Mr. Hessinger. The Scream' Game, Stolen From Life The Munch Museum in Oslo, which lost the world-famous ''Scream'' by Edvard Munch in a daring robbery last year, is drawing criticism for selling a new cops-and-robbers board game, ''The Mystery of 'The Scream,''' Agence France-Presse reported. ''My initial reaction is to disapprove of an initiative that helps trivialize a national and international drama while the painting is still missing,'' said Kaare Berntsen, the artistic director of a gallery in Oslo. But Jurunn Christoffersen, a spokeswoman for the Munch Museum, said: ''Some people think it's horrible to treat the matter as a game, but we see things totally differently. It's a completely innocent game.'' Meant for players above the age of 6, the game, created by the Aschehoug publishing house, which calls it educational, allows its participants to play either detectives or thieves. It has 36 cards featuring works of art known to the children. Funny Guy Steve Martin, accepting the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Sunday, recalled some of his other honors, including a 1969 writing Emmy for ''The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,'' The Associated Press reported. ''But of course,'' he said, ''the Mark Twain Prize is more special to me, because it's more recent.'' Between clips from his movies and television appearances, Mr. Martin, right, was saluted by actors including Tom Hanks, Lily Tomlin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short and Claire Danes, and the musicians Paul Simon and Randy Newman. Ms. Tomlin said, ''His artistry soars to heights of sublime silliness and sublime absurdity.'' PBS is to televise the tribute on Nov. 9. Just for Laughs With contributions from Shelley Berman, Dick Cavett, Phyllis Diller, Norman Lear, Jackie Mason and Jonathan Winters, among others, Emerson College in Boston has established a comedy archive. Described as the first of its kind, the collection of oral histories is intended to enhance the study of comedy as an American art form. Besides recording oral histories, the American Comedy Archives, as it is called, is collecting scripts, monographs, photographs, audio and video recordings, memorabilia and personal papers from significant figures in comedy. Diana Fountain Inquiry British lawmakers plan to question officials about the trouble-plagued $6.3 million fountain erected in Hyde Park, London, in honor of Diana, Princess of Wales, Agence France-Presse reported. Designed by the American architect Kathryn Gustafson, the monument was beset by faulty pumps, blockages, muddy grass and slippery surroundings that led to its closing for four months after it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2004. The hearing by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament was scheduled for Nov. 2. Playing for Peace Perched on the rooftops of Nicosia, the divided capital of Cyprus, musicians blew horns and banged drums yesterday to demonstrate unity on the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, Agence France-Presse reported. The event, ''Long Distance Call,'' above, was organized by the Dutch composer Merlijn Twaalfhoven. Last year he paid his first visit to the island, split between Greeks in the south and Turks in the north. ''Seeing the situation of this beautiful island being divided was a reason for me to start fantasizing about how to bridge this gap with sound and music.'' He arranged for musicians on both sides of the United Nations-patrolled buffer zone to play alternately throughout the day. Footnote Featuring the clarinet virtuoso Dan Levinson, the 13-piece Stan Rubin Orchestra will recreate the heyday of big-band swing on Tuesdays at Charley O's on Broadway at 49th Street. At 8:30 p.m. tonight, the ensemble will salute the hits of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller, with an occasional nod to Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Harry James and their contemporaries. On Monday nights, Mr. Rubin's Tigertown Five plays Chicago-style Dixieland.",4fd25f828eb7c8105d80f603,976
Singin' the Blues Before the JVC Jazz Festival,2005-06-14,"It isn't generous to pick on a jazz festival before it begins. But not to do so with this year's JVC Jazz Festival-New York, which starts today and runs until June 25, would ignore a strange turn of events. Not only is this year's JVC-New York full of sleepy or many-times-repeated bookings, weird inequities and antique fixations, but its Rhode Island cousin, JVC Jazz Festival-Newport, now clearly has the edge. The impresario George Wein, along with Elaine and Louis Lorillard, began the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954, before corporate sponsorship supported musical events. It was, as everyone now knows, the first major outdoor jazz festival in the United States, and became the model for what is now a summer jazz-festival circuit around the world, including Montreal; New Orleans; North Sea (in The Hague), Marciac (France), Perugia (Italy), Montreux (Switzerland) and on and on. Newport ran pretty astonishing programs every year, mixing pop in by degrees, then ended abruptly in 1971, when angry rock fans, there to see the Allman Brothers, gate-crashed the festival, reportedly tearing the lid off the stage piano.",4fd25e938eb7c8105d80dd51,1177
"STREETSCAPES/The Hippodrome, and the Hippodrome Building; From a Palace of Spectacles to an Edifice of Offices",2005-05-22,"THE new skin going up over the old Hippodrome Building on the west side of the Avenue of the Americas from 43rd to 44th Street is the latest chapter in the building's complicated construction saga. What is now a 20-story structure was built in 1953 five stories high; it grew the next year to eight, and it attained its present height in 1961. What was put up on the site 100 years ago, though, was much more complex -- a grand palace of theatrical and other spectacles whose name the current building memorializes. Even though the theater was demolished in 1939, the original Hippodrome -- a 5,200-seat home for stage spectaculars involving airships, Martians, elephants, Civil War battles and raging rivers -- remains to this day one of the most unusual theatrical venues ever built.",4fd2478f8eb7c8105d7e3883,1287
"How Rio Sounded in '59, How New York Sounds Right Now",2005-02-20,"Luiz Bonfá In 1959 the Brazilian guitarist, singer and composer had just made his name with the song ''Manhã de Carnaval,'' which was featured in the hit film ''Black Orpheus.'' That year Emory Cook, the American audio engineer, flew to Rio with a portable tape recorder and spent an evening pointing a microphone at him; Bonfá played his own music, American standards (''Night and Day'' and ''Tenderly'') and deft improvisations tilting toward classical-guitar technique. Bonfá, who died in 2001, was a bit older than the rest of the bossa nova gang, and, when given the opportunity to show it, more of a traditional virtuoso. But unlike João Gilberto, he has been known more as a songwriter than as an individual performer. This album, ''Solo in Rio 1959'' (Smithsonian Folkways), a reissue of Cook's recordings, corrects the imbalance. It's well recorded, honest and casual, with a lot of personality; he tries things he's clearly still tinkering with, including some through-composed pieces that are far from samba and more like classical tone poems. Bastro The overlooked power trio of late-80's underground rock was Bastro, from Louisville, Ky.; a new CD reissue on Drag City combines its two albums ''Sing the Troubled Beast'' and ''Diablo Guapo.'' It included the guitarist and singer David Grubbs (whose subsequent hard left turn into quieter, more cerebral and experimental work with Gastr del Sol is foreshadowed by a few tracks here), the bassist Clark Johnson and the drummer John McEntire, who later joined Tortoise. The disc is a good ending place for short, loud, grinding, passionate, brainy rock 'n' roll -- the kind of thing that had a hot, confessional, political charge when the Minutemen introduced it earlier in the decade, but by this point had become music about music. Ravi Coltrane One of the things to admire about the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane is the slow, methodical way he built his career. His first album, ''Moving Pictures,'' from 1998, was a tentative beginning, almost a record of sketches; he wasn't fully rounded yet, and given the opportunity to record (as any saxophone-playing son of John Coltrane would be), he didn't fake secondhand flash. A few so-so albums went by after that, and now at the age of 39, on the new ''In Flux'' (Savoy Jazz), he's come into his own. The album enlists different approaches: mysterious and moving ballads (''Away,'' ''For Zoe''); free improvisation within tight rhythmic structures (''Leaving Avignon'' and ''Scram Vamp''); a rubato ballad (''Dear Alice''); the rhythmic complexities of the new Latin jazz, negotiated with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and drummer E. J. Strickland; layered time signatures; a few short free-jazz scrimmages. Mr. Coltrane avoids tired song structures and doesn't want to bore you. He's fascinated on one hand by miniatures and on the other by the idea of longer songs that sound like collective improvisation from start to finish. It's a record that you can point to and say: This is what jazz sounds like now in New York. Dave Holland After making records for 32 years for the ECM label, the bassist and bandleader Dave Holland, one of the more important figures in jazz, has formed his own label, Dare2. Its first release is ''Overtime,'' by Mr. Holland's big band -- a relatively new 12-piece outgrowth of his more widely known quintet. With the frighteningly well calibrated quintet, you know what you're going to get: careful compositions based on ostinatos, and odd metered funk and counterpoint. The big band does more. Loud and fairly traditional, its arrangements for booming horn sections mix influences from postwar Count Basie and Duke Ellington, as well as Thad Jones; it's also music of a different temperature and mood, accommodating more slow tempos, along with some old-fashioned, take-your-time, knock-it-out-of-the-park solos. (There are a few of those here, especially by the saxophonists Chris Potter and Mark Gross, and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson.) There's a sameness in the arrangements from track to track, and nothing's particularly devastating; like a high-end station wagon, the band projects strength and solidity. John Hollenbeck Like Mr. Holland, the drummer John Hollenbeck is a rhythm-section player who leads a quintet and recently grew his music to big-band size. It's pretty clear he's the leader: rhythm provides the guiding wisdom of each piece. ''A Blessing'' (Omnitone), the first recording of his Large Ensemble, suggests one logical extension of Mr. Holland's group, toward multiple personalities. Mr. Hollenbeck is clearly interested in a huge area of contemporary music, from minimalism to African music to art song to funk to free and straight-ahead jazz. (He never sounds like he's mocking any one style, or overreaching: he figures out a way to make everything his own.) It's a real ensemble record, without many solos in the traditional jazz sense; the musicians play in tight, arranged sections, but also go to the other extreme, teasing out weird timbres and textures. Some tracks are dead serious, like ''The Music of Life,'' with a Sufi-philosophy text sung by Theo Bleckmann over clouds of slowly changing chords. Others have a dry and brainy sense of humor, and try ideas that might look dreadful on paper, like putting a shard of ''April in Paris's'' melody over a reggae rhythm and ambient horn arrangements. In some wily way, it turns out not to be dreadful at all.",4fd2839d8eb7c8105d851d5f,887
The Neediest Cases; A Teacher Helps Girls Dance Through Life,2005-01-19,"When Orlane Benau began a dance group for teenage girls five years ago, she named the group Mahogany, like the genus of tropical trees with hard reddish-brown wood. The girls, like the trees, are strong. And all of them have roots in Harlem, where the once famous dance floor at the Savoy Ballroom was made of mahogany and maple. However, this generation of teenage uptown dancers is not swinging to the music of Duke Ellington. Walk into one of the girls' rehearsals on a Friday night and all you will hear is hip-hop or rhythm and blues.",4fd2443b8eb7c8105d7de3da,1003

From the Assembly Line of a Genius,2005-01-14,"A YOUNG, ethereal-looking beauty, big-eyed, rosy-cheeked, gazes down and off to the side, lost in thought, one hand to her breast. Her frizzy hair is a tangle of black and red chalk, a halo. White highlights pick out the light on her cheekbones and chin and around her mouth. The artist understands the nuance of skin as it stretches over bone, knows how to make flesh look silken and breathe. The artist is Peter Paul Rubens, and the drawing is in the Rubens show opening this afternoon at the Metropolitan Museum. Rubens exhibitions come and go all the time in Europe, but not so often in this country, until lately, it seems. A cache of his oil sketches recently arrived at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn. And now this, the first big Rubens drawings survey ever in the United States.",4fd2a5708eb7c8105d88d3b0,1551
A Revitalization For Washington's U Street Corridor,2005-06-12,"FOR much of the first half of the 20th century, the U Street area of Washington thrived as the heart of the city's African-American community, pulsing with culture, entertainment and soul. Duke Ellington was born there, and over the years, musical legends like Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Pearl Bailey and Dizzy Gillespie performed at local clubs and at the legendary Howard Theater. ''In segregated Washington, D.C., U Street was the place to be,'' said Merrick Malone, a local real estate developer. ''It was like D.C.'s Harlem and the Apollo Theater, the epicenter of African-American life here.''",4fd25e928eb7c8105d80dce8,1127
The Return Of the Broadway Boogie-Woogie,2005-11-06,"THE choreographer Garth Fagan and Wynton Marsalis, the co-founder and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, go way back. They met in the 1980's when Mr. Fagan, a jazz aficionado, took his dancers to New York clubs to hear Mr. Marsalis play. ''I knew we could learn from him,'' Mr. Fagan said in a recent conference call with Mr. Marsalis. ''I sensed we saw things the same way.'' Eventually he invited Mr. Marsalis to a rehearsal at the company's headquarters in Rochester. ''I was young then -- 23 or 24,'' Mr. Marsalis said, ''and for him to do a performance just for me, to show me that kind of respect, like I was Duke Ellington, was actually startling. I tried to understand the choreography as well as I could with my level of sophistication, which was very little at the time. But more than the choreography, I knew him. I could understand the genius of the man and his depth of understanding of world cultures, Afro and not Afro.''",4fd264538eb7c8105d817855,1171

Turning the Music of the South and the Shtetl Into Bluesy Sophistication,2005-02-11,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dropped ''Over the Rainbow'' from early prints of ''The Wizard of Oz,'' in part because it sounded too sophisticated. It slowed down the picture, the doubters argued, and in any case, if a young girl in a Kansas farmyard suddenly broke into a song, it would not be one as philosophical and wistful as this one. ''Over the Rainbow'' stayed in the picture, of course, after some heated studio infighting, and became an instant classic. The world-weary tone may have sounded odd coming from the Kansas cornfields, but it was typical of its composer, Harold Arlen, who is best remembered today, when he is remembered at all, for composing the music for ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But that score -- particularly the lighter fare, what Arlen called the ''lemon-drop songs'' -- was a departure from the bluesy, urbane style of most of his big hits, like ''Stormy Weather,'' ''Blues in the Night'' and ''Come Rain or Come Shine.''",4fd24a4b8eb7c8105d7e829f,968

The shows have been (and will be) eclectic and somewhat Jersey-centric -- Danny Aiello, who lives in Saddle River, sang standards one night; Dominic Chianese, who plays Uncle Junior on ''The Sopranos,'' was the singing star on opening night, July 23; and New Jersey comics like Gumba Johnny and Big Daddy Graham are scheduled to appear later this month.",4fd285f68eb7c8105d85699b,1847

"History, Heard From the Inside",2005-09-02,"FOR Hank Jones, the last 60 years of jazz is not best explained by records. The entire period seems to be retained in his own head: a labor history of all the jam-session, studio, one-night and concert-hall gigs he has played since moving to New York in 1944. Mr. Jones, a pianist, has been one of the hardest and most consistent workers in the history of jazz. As a result, his focused, organized, subtle touch -- one device is to turn up the energy of his improvising while still playing softly -- shows up everywhere in the music.",4fd260f88eb7c8105d811a8f,2564

Toward a Unified Theory of Black America,2005-03-20,"Roland G. Fryer Jr. is 27 years old and he is an assistant professor of economics at Harvard and he is black. Yes, 27 is young to be any kind of professor anywhere. But after what might charitably be called a slow start in the scholarly life, Fryer has been in a big hurry to catch up. He was in fact only 25 when he went on the job market, gaining offers from -- well, just about everywhere. He abruptly ended his job search by accepting an invitation to join the Society of Fellows at Harvard, one of academia's most prestigious research posts. This meant he wouldn't be teaching anywhere for three years. The Harvard economics department told Fryer to take its offer anyway; he could have an office and defer his teaching obligation until the fellowship was done. Now that he is halfway through his fellowship, the quality and breadth of Fryer's research have surprised even his champions. ''As a pure technical economic theorist, he's of the first rate,'' says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard. ''But what's really incredible is that he's also much more of a broad social theorist -- talking to psychologists, sociologists, behavioral geneticists -- and the ideas he comes up with aren't the 'let's take the standard economic model and push a little harder' ideas. He makes you think of Nathan Glazer or William Julius Wilson, but with economic rigor.'' Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard humanities scholar, says that Fryer is ''destined to be a star. I mean, he's a star already, just a baby star. I think he'll raise the analysis of the African-American experience to new levels of rigor and bring economics into the mainstream area of inquiry within the broader field of African-American studies.''",4fd2a64a8eb7c8105d88e2b3,5711

Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Broadway 'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley) 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.(Charles Isherwood) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson) *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz is himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood) 'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood) 'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder) *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman) *'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new, ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lortel, 121 Christopher Street, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger) Off Off Broadway * 'BUSTED JESUS COMIX' Based on the story of the only cartoonist ever to be tried and convicted of obscenity, this nicely performed 65-minute satire belongs to a rich dramatic tradition of turning dirty-minded artists into First Amendment heroes. David Johnston's script touches on the trial and fills out an invented biography that gives the play a satisfying arc. Access Theater , 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman) 'THE GUT GIRLS' Like the large unwieldy carcass the Victorian-era characters must tackle in a slaughterhouse, this preachy British play by Sarah Daniels doesn't yield to either the director or the dialect coach in this revival, though several actresses manage to surmount the obstacles in a fashion (2:45). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212)868-4444. (Stevens) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'TOP TEN' Peter Gil-Sheridan's ''Top Ten'' is a paint-by-numbers series of stereotypes. The cardboard characters and predictable permutations are, in fact, numbered. Each vignette is presented as a sort of plot equation that never really adds up. This theatrical lottery, lasting more than two hours, may soon make you feel in need of a remedial math course. ''Top Ten'' is even less than the sum of its parts. Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, near 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis) *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis) *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis) 'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (A.O. Scott) 'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis) * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden) 'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott) 'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renée Zellweger also stars. (Dargis) 'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'CRÓNICAS' (R, 98 minutes, in Spanish and English) John Leguizamo is an ambitious, unscrupulous Miami reporter for a tabloid television show on the track of a serial murderer of children in an Ecuadorian village. (Holden) 'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis) 'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott) *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis) * 'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis) 'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut, gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden) 'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott) *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott) 'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott) 'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott) 'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden) *'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis) 'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott) 'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott) 'MAKING GRACE' (No rating, 86 minutes) An intimate documentary focusing on a 30-something lesbian couple who want to become parents, this is the kind of film rarely seen by those who would benefit most from its universal message.(Jeannette Catsoulis) *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden) 'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis) 'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden) *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden) * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott) '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden) 'NOVEMBER' (R, 89 minutes) The twisty paranoid thriller about a photographer's survivor's guilt and repressed memory in the wake of her boyfriend's murder is a surreal cinematic mind-tickler with not much behind its clever facade. (Holden) * 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden) *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott) ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott) 'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis) Film Series 'THE CONFORMIST' (through Aug. 11). Film Forum is screening a new 35-millimeter print of Bernardo Bertolucci's 1970 masterpiece about sex and politics in pre-World War II Italy. Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a young Fascist assigned to assassinate his onetime mentor in Paris. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates) 'DIVAS!' (through Aug. 30). This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with dramas this weekend about movie actresses in doomed relationships. Judy Garland stars in the 1954 ''A Star Is Born,'' about a celebrity whose husband (James Mason) is destroyed by her outshining him. And in ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), Gloria Swanson plays a has-been silent-screen star who passionately befriends an aspiring young screenwriter (William Holden). Both films play tomorrow and Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-1414, $10. (Gates) 'IN DEPPTH' (through Sunday) BAM Cinématek concludes its 11-film, three-week retrospective of Johnny Depp's films this weekend. Lasse Hallstrom's ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'' (1993), about a small-town Iowa family with multiple problems, is being shown today. Tomorrow and Sunday, the feature is Jim Jarmusch's anti-western ''Dead Man'' (1995), in which Mr. Depp plays a 19th-century accountant not long for this world. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)777-3456 or (718)636-4100, $10. (Gates) ERNST LUBITSCH FILM FESTIVAL (through Aug. 6). Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, is screening five films by Lubitsch (1892-1947) on consecutive Saturdays. Tomorrow's feature is ''Ninotchka'' (1939), starring Greta Garbo as a stern Soviet functionary in Paris, tempted by capitalist luxuries and romance. 35 West 67th Street, (212)601-1000, $9. (Gates) RAOUL WALSH RETROSPECTIVE (through Aug. 14). The Museum of the Moving Image's 23-film tribute to Walsh (1887-1980) continues tomorrow with ''They Died With Their Boots On'' (1941), starring Errol Flynn as George Armstrong Custer. ''Desperate Journey'' (1942), a war movie with Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan, plays on Sunday. ''High Sierra'' (1941), a gangster film noir with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino, will be shown on Saturday and Sunday. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)-784-0077, $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFRICAN FESTIVAL WITH THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED, MARIA DE BARROS AND OTHERS (Sunday) A musical pioneer, the Zimbabwean Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled Rhodesian government. His music transferred the brisk patterns of thumb piano to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. The best-known music from Cape Verde is the lilting and pensive morna. Maria de Barros sings some mornas, but also sings other Cape Verdean styles -- including bright, driving funanas -- about love, tradition and women's strength. Gokh-Bi System, Kakande and Alain Nkossi Konda also play. 2 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, free. (Jon Pareles) BABY DAYLINER, GREG GARING, GRANT HART (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band. He sets up percolating electropop patterns to back neo-cabaret songs that can be droll and cynical or stylishly heartsick. Greg Garing is a songwriter who prizes both the heart-on-sleeve simplicity of honky-tonk and the possibilities of electronica. Grant Hart played pop melodic foil to the more angular Bob Mould in the seminal post-punk band Hüsker Dü. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Pareles) BANG ON A CAN (Tuesday) Members of the forward-thinking chamber-music group Bang on a Can All-Stars play a gig with visiting Uzbek musicians. Bang on a Can performers include the percussionist David Cossin, the guitarist Mark Stewart, the cellist Wendy Sutter and the bassist Gregg August. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Laura Sinagra) BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday) This band's frontman Anton Newcombe resembles the Rolling Stones' washout genius Brian Jones in both his love for wan 1960's psychedelics and his flirtatious relationship with reality. The 2004 rock documentary ''Dig!'' showcases his mix of retro integrity and epic narcissism. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 to $17. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra) *THE CASTLE FESTIVAL: WELCOMING THE WORLD FOR 150 YEARS (Sunday) Some 74 million Americans had ancestors who passed through the Castle Garden Immigrant Depot in Battery Park. This concert celebrating its 150th anniversary is a showcase for some of the music and ideas immigrants have brought to the city, with hard-charging salsa by the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, modal Middle-Eastern jazz from Simon Shaheen's Qantara, Irish immigration songs sung by Susan McKeown, African dance by the group Kotchegna, and Albanian traditional and pop songs from Merita Halili and the accordion-powered Raif Hyseni Orchestra. 4:30 to 10 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, www.thebattery.org, free. (Pareles) CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH (Monday and Tuesday) Self-satisfied baby-boom nostalgia and close high harmonies that may be more or less in tune. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $40 to $100. (Pareles) DEAD MEADOW (Thursday) Dead Meadow plays hard rock that evokes rolling expanse the way the blues-metal the group loves once evoked misty Gothic castles. This monstrously riff-heavy band's punk roots give its grandeur a humane warmth. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra) DESTINY'S CHILD, AMERIE (Tonight and tomorrow) The R&B diva Beyoncé can seem a bit strident in her pursuit of media-blessed perfection, but her urgent, flexible voice is certainly that of a superstar. This concert is supposedly the swan song of the trio known for hits like the sublime heartbreaker ''Say My Name'' and the prematurely hardened ''Survivor.'' The opener, Amerie, matches the constantly climaxing track of her radio hit ''One Thing'' with gutsy assertion. Tonight at 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $55 to $100. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $39.50 to $92. (Sinagra) THE DIRTBOMBS, TRALALA (Tonight) The Detroit garage rocker Mick Collins's raw outfit, the Dirtbombs, tears through its live sets, unafraid of dissonance and rough edges. Mr. Collins has a more resonant voice than some of his shouty contemporaries. Local bubblegum rock experiment Tralala tops insistent guitar surge with lackadaisical girl-group vocals. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15. (Sinagra) DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, BARENAKED LADIES, BLACK EYED PEAS, JEM, MIKE DOUGHTY AND OTHERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This outdoor lineup should please anybody looking for a noodle-dance vibe without too many extended solos. Dave Matthews still traffics in everyman erotics, while the Black-Eyed Peas play cultural ambassadors to the hip-hop-deprived. The British sprite Jem writes and sings upbeat trip-pop, and the Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty spews half-baked urban poetry. Other acts include Randolph and the Family Band and Ray Lamontagne.Noon, Randall's Island Golf Center, 1 Randalls Island, (212)427-5689, $55 to $62 (tomorrow's show sold out). (Sinagra) DURAN DURAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Still looking good in white suits after all these years, the new-wave band that gave us hits like ''Hungry Like the Wolf'' puts on a vigorous live show. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $75. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $75.(Sinagra) EXTRA ACTION MARCHING BAND, OXFORD COLLAPSE, TALL FIRS, ONEIDA (Tomorrow) The anarchic San Francisco Extra Action Marching Band began as a ''procession band'' for the raucousCrash Worship. As of late, the core group, with its horns, drum corps and shimmying dancers, has played dates with David Byrne. The local trio Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forbears like the Embarrassment. Tall Firs and Oneida also play. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Sinagra) DAVID GRAY (Tuesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door (sold out). (Pareles) JIM AND JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Wednesday) Unlike a lot of younger alt-country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high, lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778, $15.

(Pareles) *LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Thursday) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. 6 to 9 p.m., El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem. As part of the Latin Alternative Music Conference (www.latinalternative.com), it's a free concert. (Pareles) MC5 (Tonight) These working-class Detroit toughs played scab-picking, drug-dabbling proto-punk rock amid the hippie era. The original members Michael Davis, Dennis Thompson and the long-winded raconteur guitarist Wayne Kramer reunite to perform their album, ''Kick Out the Jams'' (Elektra), in its uncensored entirety. The band also plays tomorrow with the Sun Ra Arkestra at Central Park SummerStage (see Sun Ra below). 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $25.

(Pareles) OLIVIA TREMOR CONTROL (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of the bands central to the Athens, Ga., collective Elephant 6, which flourished in the mid-90's indie underground, Olivia Tremor Control melded Beatlesesque melodies and Mersey beat bounce with loopy, slacker flophouse psychedelia. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra) LIZ PHAIR (Monday and Tuesday) This singer-songwriter, beloved for her early, sexy lo-fi missives, has caught flack for attempts at universal pop reach. But to her credit, her dirty-30's quirkiness shone through the slick production on her last effort. A new album, ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol), is supposedly more elemental. Monday at 7 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777, $25. (Sinagra) RONNIE SPECTOR AND THE UPTOWN HORNS (Wednesday) Ronnie Spector's gutsy, fervently out-of-tune voice made ''Be My Baby'' an indelible plea and a touchstone for New York (and New Jersey) rock ever since. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, www.hudsonriverfestival.com, free.

(Sinagra) PATTI SMITH (Thursday) As resolutely pretentious as ever, the punk poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators like Eleanor Friedberger of the Fiery Furnaces. Hip kids can come see the real thing howl classics like ''Gloria'' and declaim topical rants like ''Radio Baghdad.'' 7:30 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Sinagra) RATT, QUIET RIOT, CINDERELLA, FIREHOUSE (Tomorrow) This bill includes four prominent 1980's hair metal bands.

(Sinagra) JAMES BLOOD ULMER (Thursday) The guitarist James Blood Ulmer made his name in jazz groups led by Art Blakey and Ornette Coleman, but he has deep roots in swampy, raucous blues. Singing in grizzled tones, plunking out notes with a thumb or making his guitar blurt feedback, he's in touch with both Son House and Jimi Hendrix. Noon, BAM's R&B Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles) WHITE OUT WITH JIM O'ROURKE AND THURSTON MOORE (Tomorrow) Lin Culbertson and Tom Surgal, of the experimental group White Out, make experimental rock with analog synthesizers, autoharp, flute, drums, gongs, chains and the like. They are joined by two regular co-conspirators, the ubiquitous post-rock jack of all trades Jim O'Rourke and Thurston Moore, whose sonic youth has morphed into questing, noisy adulthood. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $12.

Opera GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) To be counted among the country's leading summer opera festivals, it helps to have imagination and unusual repertory, and Glimmerglass offers both in spades. All four of the season's operas are now in rotation. One highlight is a new production of Benjamin Britten's wonderful and too-seldom-performed ''Death in Venice,'' directed by Tazewell Thompson and featuring William Burden. The season's other offerings are Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' the French version of Donizetti's ''Lucie de Lammermoor'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone.

(Anne Midgette) 'REGINA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Most people know Lillian Hellman's play ''The Little Foxes'' from William Wyler's classic 1941 film version starring Bette Davis as the ruthless matriarch of a crumbling Southern family. But in 1949 the American composer Marc Blitzstein, whose centennial is being celebrated this year, introduced his operatic version, titled ''Regina'' after the main character. With its populist score -- a deft melding of spiky contemporary harmony, jazzy bits and American vernacular music -- the opera has been gaining adherents over the years. Bard College's SummerScape series is presenting a production directed by Peter Schneider and conducted by Leon Botstein, with the fearless soprano Lauren Flanigan in the Davis role. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900, $35 to $65. (Anthony Tommasini) Classical Music ASTON MAGNA (Tomorrow) The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire foothills?

Oestreich) BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Tomorrow, and Monday through Thursday) Since new music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art world than in many concert halls, Bang on a Can takes its concerts into a museum -- specifically, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, where two informal concerts a day showcase the faculty and participants of its summer learning program.

(Kozinn) MOSTLY MOZART (Monday through Thursday) Mozart has gotten a new shine in New York: at least, this perennially popular Lincoln Center-based festival bearing his name has a new spring in its step, and on its program, since Louis Langrée became its music director two years ago. Certainly the festival orchestra is sounding better, as it should demonstrate in concerts during the first week of a season organized around the theme of ''Mozart's Travels,'' extending its embrace all the way to Russia, where Mozart never actually went. Mozart in Vienna is the focus on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a piece by Haydn and three by Mozart, including the Piano Concerto No. 22 with Emanuel Ax, and a concert aria with the soprano Emma Bell. Mr. Ax also offers two hourlong late-night concerts, one with Ms. Bell, in a series called ''A Little Night Music.''

Tonight it plays works by Beethoven, Schubert and Hikaru Hayashi, and tomorrow some of its members join other performers in works by Brahms. 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860)542-3000, $15 to $45; ages 18 to 25, $10; under 18, free with a paying adult.

(Jack Anderson) *BOLSHOI BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) The Bolshoi Ballet closes its two-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House -- another two weeks in Pennsylvania, Virginia and California will complete its American tour -- with three performances of ''The Pharaoh's Daughter.'' This is a 2000 reconstruction by Pierre Lacotte of an early Petipa Egyptian fantasy. Although Sergei Filin has had to drop out of his scheduled performances as Lord Wilson, the leading role of Aspicia should be in good hands: Maria Alexandrova tonight, Svetlana Lunkina tomorrow afternoon and Svetlana Zakharova tomorrow night. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.metopera.org; $45 to $150. (John Rockwell) DODGE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Susan Dodge choreographically combines explosive energy with humor and musicality. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479; $15; students, $12.

(Anderson) JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 28) Tonight through Sunday the Mark Morris Dance Group and Aszure, a modern-dance troupe led by Aszure Barton, wind up their runs at the Pillow. Wednesday through Aug. 7, a venturesomely inclined ballet troupe from Stockholm called 59degrees North will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater.

She's also a belly dancer. ''Hafla'' means party in Arabic. And Oreet's ''Ultimate Belly Dance Hafla'' celebrates that art as an example of both muscular control and spiritual expression. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155; $15 with a one-drink minimum. (Anderson) PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow) Dancers bend like pretzels and tie themselves into knots in acrobatic choreography that stretches the performers' bodies and viewers' minds. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $42; Joyce members, $32.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith) AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Glueck) THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, are from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter) *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith) GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,' through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck) *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith) *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith) MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson) *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman) *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman) UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept.18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith) Galleries: Uptown *'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN' ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. Neue Gallerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, through Sept. 26. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE' More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson) CHRISTIÁN SILVA: 'THE ENGLISH GARDEN' The best works by this Guadalajara-based artist are puzzling but have a visceral material presence. The trembling green rubber hands sticking out from a wall holding bunches of real parsley and coriander are especially weird. The life-size green man on the floor under a pile of vegetables is strange, too. But the big charcoal wall drawing of a drum kit is forgettable. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212)688-4673, through Aug. 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea *'BEBE LE STRANGE' This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)352-9460, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) *'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' The big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson, and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter) *'GREY FLAGS' Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) 'IDOLS OF PERVERSITY' Inspired by a 1980's book with the subtitle ''Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin de Siècle Culture,'' this show substitutes Surrealism for Symbolism for its prevailing mode, academic painting as its preferred style, and the contemporary art star John Currin as its patron saint. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Aug. 6. (Cotter) DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson) 'LIVING FOR THE CITY' Organized by an institution-in-formation, the Brooklyn Institute of Contemporary Art, this group show has artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, some making New York debuts. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Aug. 5. (Cotter) 'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, (212)627-8000, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) *'WALLS 'N' THINGS' This show about illusion and ambiguity includes a big, tough graffiti piece lifted from Barbie packaging; wall braces that support nothing; and a wall painting that isn't there until you suddenly see it, after which it is really, really there. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 213, (212)243-3335, through Aug. 5.(Cotter) Other Galleries 'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson) JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson) 'DEAD KIDS DO NOTHING' It's hard to say what this better-than-average group show adds up to, but it includes a sweetly quixotic video by Lee Walton in which he makes minor alterations to outdoor situations he encounters; another video, of a swimming mouse shot from under water by Adam Stennett, the show's organizer; lonesome modern interiors drawn in blue ink by Rebecca Chamberlain; and a dreamy, elegiac photograph of a dead pigeon shot with a pinhole camera by Jan Dunning. 31 Grand, 31 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-2858, through Aug. 7. (Johnson) JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson) SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson) Last Chance *'ATOMICA: MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE' This carefully orchestrated international group show marks the 60th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9, 1945. Shiva Ahmadi, Ellen Levy, Nancy Spero and Hiroshi Sunairi contribute subtle work. Esso Gallery (212)560-9728, 531 West 26th Street, second floor, and Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, (212)967-8040, 531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, closing today. (Cotter) 'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the Communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, pronounced ''win.'' He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ''Happy Birthday War.'' PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)564-4480, closing today. (Johnson) 'FEAR GEAR' The best piece in this mildly political show is Maria Marshall's video ''The Emperor and His Clothes,'' in which a boy puts on and takes off absurd amounts of clothing while the soundtrack plays layered excerpts from a speech by President Bush. Also: a video of Patty Chang dancing while being splattered by paint; a knotted and suggestively dangling rubber baseball bat by Via Lewandowsky; and a mural of military clothing fragments by Jean Shin. Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-8180, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) *THE GENERAL'S JAMBOREE: SECOND ANNUAL WATERCOLOR EXHIBITION Watercolor is a chronically underestimated art medium -- painting's poorer, implicitly feminine cousin. This may be one reason so many young artists have embraced it, armed with all kinds of intentions and techniques, including a few pointed at three dimensions, and also why this exhibition is, indeed, an exuberant jamboree. With the vogue for multimedia, it is also clarifying to see more than three score artists concentrating on just one. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212)625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith) *'I THROW HERRING TO THE DOG' Lillian Ludlow and Marcella Mullins, the curators of this odd and charming group show, are both clothes designers and artists, which may help explain the aesthetic of precision and improvisation that reigns here in work by Rita Ackerman, Kenneth Boyer Kloster, Sadie Laska and Patrick O'Leary, among others. Canada, 55-59 Chrystie Street, between Canal and Hester Streets, Lower East Side, (212)925-4631, closing on Sunday.(Cotter) 'IT'LL COST YOU ' In observance of the curious fact that Colonial American painters charged according to the number of human limbs visible in a picture, the collector Beth Rudin DeWoody has assembled a wildly pluralistic, often funny and kinky show of works that feature arms or legs by more than 40 artists. It ranges from a frieze of women's legs in high heels crisply painted by John Wesley to the hacked-off arm of an ape sculpted by Tony Matelli. Don't miss the tiny, finely made and well-shod wooden legs by Holly Laws in the backroom. Kathleen Cullen, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8500, closing tomorrow. (Johnson). 'THE JEWELEIGHA SET' The works in this sharply focused yet ecumenical show of six artists inspired by fractal geometry fits together like a kind of rebus about the joy of numbers and numerousness in art, mathematics and nature. Greene Naftali Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, closing today. (Smith) 'PHILOSOPHICAL TOYS' This exceptionally interesting show introduces three ingenious people who have studied learning and cognition through toylike objects and gamelike processes: Friedrich Fröbel, the inventor of kindergarten; Shea Zellweger, who created toys for teaching his own system of logic; and Jeannine Mosely, a software engineer who explores paper folding. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212)431-5270, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his longtime collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, closing today. (Johnson) MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting, in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art; and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, closing on Sunday. (Smith) AERNOUT MIK: 'REFRACTION' In a plotless, silent 30-minute film, the camera slowly surveys the elaborately constructed aftermath of a bus accident on a rural highway. Though the show is well produced and absorbing to watch, you may find yourself wondering more about what it cost than about what it means. New Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222, through Sept. 10.(Johnson) 'MIRAGE' The desert and hallucination are the intertwined images here, in fine work by Jennifer Bolande, Robert Bordo, Moyra Davey, Robert Kinmont, Mary Lum, Stephan Pascher and Florian Pumhösl. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing today. (Cotter) *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940' This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272, closing on Sunday. (Cotter) MUSEUM AT THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S' through July 30. Constructed around a selection of dresses from the institute's collection, this thought-provoking exhibition briefly tells what happened when the Germans invaded Paris, forcing that city to surrender its role as leader of world fashion to New York City -- at least until the end of the war. Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212)217-7999, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) 'PAINT IT WITH BLACK' Black is the bottom line in this handsome show, organized by the artist Phong Bui, which includes enigmatic little night thoughts from Forrest Bess, Philip Guston, Bill Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski; a big one from Christopher Martin; and a rare sighting of work by the writer-curator-art historian Robert Storr. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing today. (Cotter) RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark-minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic painted heads of grimacing men with secret-society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-5949, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) *'SOMETHING IS SOMEWHERE' With art by 20 young artists, all women, this show makes an implicit feminist statement and offers art of formal variety and narrative intensity. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 504, Chelsea, (646)234-8645, closing tomorrow. (Cotter) *'THIS SIDE TOWARD SCREEN' With the arrival of digital imaging, slide projection became archaic technology, but as an artist's medium, it has a long and continuing history, which is touched on in new work here. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212)463-7372, closing today. (Cotter) *'WE COULD HAVE INVITED EVERYONE' Depending on your interest, this excellent, sprawling show about the micronations and fictive states founded by artists, eccentrics, political malcontents and other subversives will either feel like the tip of the iceberg or overload. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516A West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, closing today. (Smith)",4fd25f0f8eb7c8105d80ed03,14902

Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. 'DRUMSTRUCK' Previews start Thursday. Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show.

Written by Siberian brothers Vladimir and Oleg Presnyakov (1:20) The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley) 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Beginning Monday the theater will be renamed the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real-estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialouge with such pure love for the athletics of acting? (1:45). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winner (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger) * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood) 'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette) * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'PERSEUS' Performed in ancient Greek, ''Perseus'' tells the saga of the son of Zeus who slew the serpent-headed Medusa and saved Andromeda from a sea monster. Staged by Ellen Stewart, the production has the flamboyant pageantry and occasional ridiculousness of a low rent runway show (1:40). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, (212)475-7710. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961. (Genzlinger) 'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large transvestite (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) 'THE HAPPY PRINCE' This is a lovely Scottish production of Oscar Wilde's fairy tale about a statue and a swallow who help the poor and pay a great price. Very little of the Wilde wit has survived the adaptation, but the play may prompt children to turn to his original (1:00). The New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Gates) 'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind'' (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Monday. (Andrea Stevens) 'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis) 'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden) 'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis) 'ANOTHER ROAD HOME' (not rated, 79 minutes). This fascinating film documents the Israeli director Danae Elon's attempt to reconnect with the male Palestinian caregiver who lived with her family. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. (A.O. Scott) 'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis) * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, 6 hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott) 'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis) 'CASUISTRY: THE ART OF KILLING A CAT' (not rated, 88 minutes). In 2001, three young men in Toronto tortured and killed a domestic cat and videotaped themselves doing it. This upsetting incident and its aftermath are the subjects of this documentary that will leave viewers eager to discuss the limits of artistic freedom and the extension of ''human rights'' to animals. (Dana Stevens) 'DEATH OF A DYNASTY' (R, 74 minutes). Watching Damon Dash's playful movie is like entering a room where a large, noisy party is going on and never fully adjusting to the dark or the din. A young white reporter goes behind the scenes in the hip-hop world and thinks he knows a lot more than he does. (Anita Gates) 'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott) 'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Stevens) * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott) * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis) '15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young nonprofessional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens) * 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes). Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott) 'THE GIRL FROM MONDAY' (not rated, 84 minutes). Like so many science fiction fantasies, this deadpan comedy, which is ''Brave New World'' Lite, begins with a witty premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story. (Holden) 'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott) 'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden) 'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott) * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes). In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis) * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish). The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott) 'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden) 'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott) 'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott) 'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis) 'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden) 'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott) 'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes). Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden) * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott) 'MADISON' (PG, 105 minutes). This film about hydroplane racing in a small Indiana town wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. The cast does a fine job, but only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems are likely to appreciate the story. (Gates) 'THE MAN WHO COPIED' (not rated, 124 minutes, in Portuguese). From kitchen-sink realism, to unconvincing caper fantasy, this Brazilian film about a photocopier-turned-counterfeiter loses its bearings the moment it leaps from one to the other. (Holden) 'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott) * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott) * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis) 'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis) 'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis) 'ONE MISSED CALL' (not rated, 100 minutes; in Japanese). Take the Japanese horror film ''Ringu,'' replace the deadly videotapes with killer cellphones, and add a baroque, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink climactic sequence involving ghosts, zombies, disembodied limbs and pickled fetuses. Are you sure you want to take this call? (Stevens) 'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel) 'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott) 'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott) 'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden) 'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis) 'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott) 'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis) 'STALIN'S WIFE' (not rated, 104 minutes; in English and Russian). This dense biographical collage of images and memories of the Soviet dictator's second wife, Nadezhda, has a paradoxical quality. While many of the facts of her life are in dispute, the film evokes a fairly defined portrait of a strong, decisive, well-educated woman destroyed by a paranoid husband. (Holden) 'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott) * '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean). A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott) * 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens) * 'À TOUTE DE SUITE' (not rated, 96 minutes; in French). This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden) 'THE TUNNEL' (not rated, 157 minutes; in German). While the Berlin Wall stood, countless tunnels were planned as escape routes. This emotionally gripping film recounts the digging of the most famous one. (Laura Kern) 'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott) 'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax and a cloying conclusion, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens) 'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (not rated, 45 minutes). A choppy, bumpy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Martel) 'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens) 'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis) Film Series 'GREY GARDENS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image celebrates Mother's Day with a screening of this legendary 1975 vérité portrait of an eccentric mother and daughter -- the aunt and first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- who live together in isolation in a decaying East Hampton mansion. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; free with admission; museum admission: $10; $7.50 for 65+ and students; $5 for children, ages 5 to 18; free for members and children under 5. (Stevens) 'MICHAEL POWELL: BEAUTY UNENDING' (through May 31) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's major centennial tribute to this British director begins today and continues through the end of the month. The first weekend's offerings range from ''The Red Shoes,'' a lush ballet melodrama starring Moira Shearer, to ''Peeping Tom,'' the story of a serial killer who films his dying victims, which so shocked audiences upon its release in 1960 that it effectively destroyed Powell's career. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10; $7 for students, $6 for members, $5 for children and 65+. (Stevens) 'RECENT FINNISH FILM' (through May 8) The Brooklyn Academy of Music's roundup of Finnish cinema includes ''Pearls and Pigs,'' a comedy about four drunken karaoke-singing brothers, and ''Seven Songs From the Tundra,'' the first feature film written in the language of the Nenet tribe and filmed near the Arctic Circle. 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718) 636-4100; $10; $6 for members, $7 for 65+, students and children.

NYC Cantor Film Center, 36 East Eighth Street; (888) 222-9575, $8; $6 for 65+, students and disabled. (Stevens) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AUKTYON (Sunday and Monday) These veterans of the Leningrad rock club scene known for their Dadaist lyrics and riotous stage show fuse traditional folk with frenetic punk and jazz.

(Laura Sinagra) AUTECHRE (Sunday) This British techno group made compelling mid-90's electronic music at once too dark for dancing and too funky for headphone reverie. Its eighth album, ''Untitled'' (Warp), posits the erotic potential of a drill-press in a basement full of rattling ducts and dripping pipes. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra) THE BEAT MASTERS: DA BEATMINERZ, PRINCE PAUL, NICOLAY (Tonight) The beat-makers behind 90's underground hip-hop projects like Black Moon perform their latest collaborations. The bill includes a D.J. set by the trickster impresario Prince Paul, and the Dutch D.J. Nicolay, whose beats channel American soul. 10 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com, $12. (Sinagra) * BOBBY BARE JR.,JON LANGFORD (Tonight) Bobby Bare Jr. is an even more eccentric Nashville songwriter than his father was. His music can float down-home Americana in a psychedelic haze; his lyrics are blunt, unsentimental and pugnacious. He is joined by Langford, the leader of English punk legends the Mekons, who bawls his way through songs full of history, surrealism and twang. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Jon Pareles) JAMES BROWN (Wednesday) He may not do as many splits as he did in his physical prime, but he is still one of the most unpredictable performers around. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Pareles) BUILT TO SPILL (Wednesday and Thursday) Doug Martsch, the leader of this Idaho-based band, is one of indie rock's foremost improvisatory guitarists. In the 90's, his balance of keen melodic sense, exploratory shimmer, and Neil Young-ish vocals endeared his band to a larger fan base than that of most guitar noodlers. The band tours this summer and plans to release its first album in four years this fall. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $19.50 in advance, $20 at the door; sold out. (Sinagra) DAT POLITICS (Monday) This trio from Lille, France, mixes glitch-pop crackle and deconstructed dance beats to suggest a sunny junkyard picnic, complete with mechanical birds. 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com, $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) EARLIMART, OKKERVIL RIVER (Tonight) On the latest release by the California dreamers Earlimart, ''Treble & Tremble'' (Palm Pictures), the songwriter Aaron Espinoza conveys a raw grief over the death of fellow songwriter and friend Elliott Smith, seeking to channel his trademark melodic sadness.

(Sinagra) FISCHERSPOONER (Thursday) The heavily conceptual art-world buzz and gallery extravaganzas of Fischerspooner didn't turn its electro ditties into hits; now the band is back on a more humble scale. After party with Misshapes DJ crew ($10). 9 p.m. Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212)941-8100, $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door.

(Sinagra) GOGOL BORDELLO (Tonight) Led by a gruff and extravagantly mustachioed Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oom-pah that's the makings of a rowdy party. DeVotchKa and Skampida share the bill. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $23.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles) PATTY GRIFFIN (Tomorrow) This pensive singer-songwriter diverged from the Lilith Fair folk of her early 90's albums to walk the rootsier path, touring and recording with Emmylou Harris and Gillian Welch and having her songs recorded by the Dixie Chicks. Her recent album, ''Impossible Dream'' (ATO), looks wistfully at life through a cigarette-smoke blur. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra) HEAD AUTOMATICA (Tuesday) A blend of squiggly hip-hop and rock blast from Daryl Palumbo of the New York hardcore band Glassjaw and the producer Dan (the Automator) Nakamura.

King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra) LINK WRAY (Tuesday) Link Wray's ''Rumble'' introduced the distorted sound of a busted amplifier speaker to rock and roll, but he's far more than a novelty. Steeped in blues and rockabilly, he's the punky forefather of Southern rock. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles) * MARS VOLTA (Tonight) Southwest borderland alternative rock moves further into prog metal and King Crimson territory on the second album by this band founded by former members of indie crushers.

(Sinagra) PETE MISER (Tonight) This underground hip-hop D.J. and emcee is more literal in his narratives than contemporaries like Atmosphere's Slug, but possesses an infectious zest for bohemian city life. His music also recently appeared in the basketball documentary ''Through the Fire,'' which was shown recently at the TriBeCa Film Festival. 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10 in advance, 12 at the door.

(Kelefa Sanneh) NIGHT OF A THOUSAND STEVIES (Tonight) For devotees of the Stevie Nicks of ''Rhiannon'' and ''Belladonna'' this 15th annual lip-synch-heavy tribute to Fleetwood Mac's songstress is a chance for fans to don a diaphanous shawl and join in a night of white winged doves and crystal worship. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15. (Sinagra) PAPA ROACH, TRUSTCOMPANY, NO WARNING (Monday) The Northern California rap-rockers Papa Roach howl their ''bad childhood'' complaints over chunky guitars and a big beat.

(Sinagra) PREFUSE 73 (Tonight and Tomorrow) The atmospheric indie hip-hop D.J. Scott Herron's latest album ''Surrounded By Silence'' (Warp) features guests like Ghostface Killah and Blonde Redhead's Kazu. Live, he may rework some new material as instrumentals, influenced perhaps by his openers, the noise-rock Battles, jazztronic FourTet, and the rapid-rapping Beans. Tonight at 9 p.m. Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15; sold out. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20.

(Sinagra) ROOTS MANUVA, AIRBORN AUDIO (Tomorrow) A lot of British hip-hop grime has appeared since Manuva's dub-inflected flow snagged a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2001. Former Anti-Pop Consortium backpack rappers High Priest and M. Sayyid also aim to conjure past magic as Airborn Audio. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $18. (Sinagra) EULENE SHERMAN (Tomorrow) In the vein of gutsy gals like Sally Crewe, Eulene Sherman writes simple, satisfying melodies. Her voice can sound like a breathier Sheryl Crow, offsetting the quirkiness of lyrics like ''All your chemicals/All the time/All in all/Collide with mine.'' 8 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-7235, free. (Sinagra) * SONGS OF THE SUFI BROTHERHOODS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Mystical Sufism uses kinetic rhythms and soaring voices in the search for divine ecstasy.

(Sinagra) SOULIVE (Tomorrow) Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz for dancers who like straightforward funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop, as it does here with the beat-making X-Ecutioners. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles) STEREO TOTAL (Wednesday) Epitomizing the Continental hipster art culture of Berlin, the multi-instrumentalists in this band since the mid-90's have come from several countries across Europe. Their latest record shows they still move deftly from the swinging London sound to candy punk to electronic new wave. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sinagra) * WEEZER (Wednesday and Thursday) When these nerd rock melodists followed their hit 1994's eponymous debut (Geffen) with 1996's darker ''Pinkerton'' (Geffen), they never imagined being embraced by a fanatical cult of emo kids. Front man Rivers Cuomo indulges his glam and metal affinities on the band's Queen-like single ''Beverly Hills.'' (Geffen). 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, (212) 777-6800, $32 in advance, $37 at the door; sold out. (Sinagra) THE WONDER STUFF, AMBULANCE LTD. (Sunday) The British folk-pop band Wonder Stuff's idea of brashness always made more sense to fans across the pond. They broke up in 1994, but have reunited with a new album that evidences a still-bratty attitude. With dreamy local shoe-gazers Ambulance Ltd. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $20 in advance, $25 at the door.

Museums AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. Also at the museum: ''Self and Subject.'' 45 West 53rd Street (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith). AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times are used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West at 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Grace Glueck) BARD GRADUATE CENTER FOR STUDIES IN THE DECORATIVE ARTS, DESIGN AND CULTURE: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments and represents 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, the innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith) * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Víctor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter) MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST' Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises tucked in. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck) NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck) THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'BYRDCLIFFE: AN AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS COLONY,' through May 15. In its heyday this colony for artists, musicians and writers in Woodstock, N.Y., produced rugged, elegantly designed Arts and Crafts furniture, plus pottery, painting, jewelry, metalwork and textiles. The colony's spirit pervades the show in photographs and other memorabilia. 170 Central Park West, at 76th Street, (212)873-3400. (Glueck) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman) STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3633. (Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: 'DRAWINGS' The German Expressionist applied his sharp insights and rapid sketching facility to everything; the feelingness of his line gives strong emotional power to this show. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212)988-1623, through May 14. (Glueck) JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson) * WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, through May 21. (Smith) TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese facility for the artistically talented mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212)925-1200, through May. (Johnson) * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLINT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith) MOYNA FLANNIGAN: 'A PIE IN THE KISSER' Ms. Flannigan, who teaches in Glasgow, makes queasily erotic paintings of older, Rococo-era women, which owe much to John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage. But she has her own suave painterly touch, a smoldering palette of muted reds and greens and a zanily morbid sense of humor. Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212)727-9330, through May 14. (Johnson) SAM KUSACK: 'PHASE THREE: SUBSTRATES' Mr. Kusack's sleek industrial fountain of cut-out aluminum, metal tubing and a supposedly real meteorite is like a prop for a science fiction movie. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson) 'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith) QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212)414-1169, through May 28. (Johnson) MICHAEL RYAN Using his training in the art of decorative marbleizing, this self-taught painter creates dreamy, primordial landscapes sparsely populated by bizarrely abstracted animals and people. Together, the brushy painting and the visionary imagery create a scary, feverish feeling. Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-9723, through June 4. (Johnson) ANGELA STRASSHEIM: 'LEFT BEHIND' The large, extraordinarily vivid color photographs in this New York solo debut have a subtly gripping archetypal magic. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212)627-3363, through May 14. (Johnson) JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast. Ms. Wallace invites us to read this as a commentary on Modernist purity, the shooting of Andy Warhol and the assassination of President Kennedy. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through May 28. (Johnson) JIM WRIGHT: 'TWO COATS FOR THE TEMPERANCE REEL' In thick, glossy, candy-colored acrylics, Mr. Wright paints big neo-hippie pictures of guitars, musicians, magic forests and totemic animals. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson) Other Galleries * ALBERTO CASADO: 'TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, (212)219-0473, through June 25. (Johnson) MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, which has meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith) ''GLASS, SERIOUSLY'' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson) Last Chance * 'SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' through Wednesday. For his solo show, Mr. Tiravanija built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials and papered the gallery's walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same, raising issues of government control and First Amendment rights. (See above.) (Cotter) NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through Sunday. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue, near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith) * LUCAS SAMARAS: 'PHOTOFLICKS (IMOVIES) AND PHOTOFICTIONS (A TO Z)' Sixty short, surrealistic home-made digital movies and 4,432 still images by an extraordinarily inventive, versatile and idiosyncratic artist. His best gallery show in years. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)421-3293, through tomorrow. (Johnson) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through Sunday. This show starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. (See above.) (Cotter)",4fd2478b8eb7c8105d7e35ee,15609

Broadway 'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley) 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Jerry Zaks's revival of the 1983 musical often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers(2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are on a rampage in Daniel Sullivan's carnage-happy interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy. Dripping blood and breathing smoke, these specters are chewing up everything in their path: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, the play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. But the show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as a middle-aged American abroad (2:15). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a supsected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' In Robert Harling's freeze-dried comedy, people speak in the kinds of sentences that wind up embroidered on decorative pillows. But despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley) * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, directed by Anthony Page and starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry. She needs to verify the authenticity of a few ""confiscated"" works, for a public bonfire of degenerate art (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood) 'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat and shiny leather boots, her hair styled in a sleek blond cap, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the but mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood) 'FAUST IN LOVE' The Target Margin Theater's take on Goethe's metaphysical epic of a professor selling his soul to the devil for knowledge comes off with all the sophistication of an over-long ''Saturday Night Live'' skit (1:15). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)358-3657. (Phoebe Hoban) 'HOT 'N' THROBBING' I'm not sure if Paula Vogel's play is a comedy about domestic abuse or a tragedy about the effects of pornography, but the fact that a good argument could be made for either (or both) says something about the ambitions of this curious, clever and often frustrating jumble of a play about a mother of two who pays the bills by writing adult-film screenplays (1:30). Signature Theater Company, 555 West 42nd Street, (212)244-7529. (Jason Zinoman) * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters on stage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive than they actually are if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind ''Lazer Vaudeville,'' a hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind.'' Taking her cue from Mr. Hutchinson's antic approach, Lynne Meadow directs the proceedings with riding crop in hand (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood) 'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048. (Zinoman) 'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444. (Andrea Stevens) * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BONNIE PARKER' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow, but in her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character, a young Texas woman who is bored before she meets Barrow and dissatisfied afterward (2:00). John Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'ROMANCE' In the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, David Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either (1:35). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' A surprisingly mischievous rendering of George Bernard Shaw's first play, an 1892 bit of social criticism masquerading as a love story (2:15). 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, (212)598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200 (Isherwood). Off Off Broadway 'THE AUDIENCE' Conceived and directed by Jack Cummings III, the show has been assembled from contributions by a few dozen writers, composers and lyricists. While there are moments both sentimental and funny here, most of the contributors seem to have obeyed an official mandate to stick strictly to stereotype (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101 (Isherwood). 'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce (2:30). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette). 'FIT TO KILL' It takes a certain type of actor to pull off comic noir, but someone forgot to tell whoever cast ''Fit to Kill,'' a who's-going-to-murder-whom thriller (2:00) . Clurman, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger) 'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large transvestite (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley). 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BELFAST BLUES' Geraldine Hughes's solo show is a heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'CALIGULA.' Playing the famously vainglorious Roman ruler Caligula reinvented as a postmodern actor-cum-director, gasbag moralist and irreverent critic of biographies about himself, Andre De Shields is phenomenal (1:25). Classical Theater of Harlem, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'DECO DIVA' Kara Wilson plays the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka, living in Paris in 1939. In the course of the play, Ms. Wilson paints a copy of Lempicka's ''Beautiful Rafaela,'' which feels like a parlor trick but adds needed texture to this stylish but lightweight work (1:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Gates) * 'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' This show is a typical Richard Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological-Hysteric at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650, closing on Sunday. (Brantley). 'GOING TO ST. IVES' Questions of life and death are probed and settled over pots of tea in Lee Blessing's thoughtful, tidy two-hander. But if the play's structural and thematic niceties are intellectually pleasing, they also imbue it with a hollow, manufactured quality (2:00). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Audience members strong enough to sit through this jukebox show will discover that the production does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good (2:15). O'Neill, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'LUNA' At the New Victory, no vaudevillians are juggling fire; rather, greater daring is on display by the Belgian troupe Pantalone: original chamber music for kindergartners. Accompanied only by a narrator, this is more multi-media concert than theater, with narrative music that dances wildly when devils fight (1:30). 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Miriam Horn) 'PLAY IN A PUB' As a wry young Frenchwoman, Kelli Holsopple persuades you that you are not in a bar in the East Village watching Romulus Linney's one-act play ''Can Can,'' but in France, with her. The evening opens with ''A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot,'' a burlesque by Tennessee Williams about two lonely women of a certain age (1:30). Bacchus Room, Bona Fides Restaurant, 60 Second Avenue, at Third Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Thursday. (Andrea Stevens) 'THIS IS HOW IT GOES' Ben Stiller, famous in movies as an everyklutz, is the ideal guide for escorting audiences through the slippery maze of Neil LaBute's extended ploy of a play. In this story of an interracial romantic triangle, Mr. Stiller gives an artfully layered, deceptive performance that leaves you thinking it's a pity he had to portray a moral construct instead of a character (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'WHAT OF THE NIGHT' A solo show starring Jane Alexander as Djuna Barnes, the literary adventurer best known for her spooky modernist novel ''Nightwood,'' this curio combines some of the standard facets of dead-celebrity stage plays with the more rarefied and often inscrutable behaviors endemic in the world of performance art (1:15). Lortel, 121 Christopher Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) 'WHEN THE BULBUL STOPPED SINGING' This s a one-man, one-note chronicle of the events beginning on March 29, 2002, when Israeli troops invaded Ramallah and surrounded Yasir Arafat's headquarters. The Scottish playwright David Greig's simplistic account of this enormously complex situation does a disservice to both sides (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Hoban) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden) 'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Manohla Dargis) 'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular (A.O. Scott) 'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis) 'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali), A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta (Scott). 'BE COOL' (PG-13, 112 minutes). John Travolta returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in ''Get Shorty,'' which arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction.'' But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty (Dargis) * 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, six hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott) 'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis) 'CONSTANTINE' (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Keanu Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. (Scott) 'DEAD AND BREAKFAST' (not rated, 88 minutes). Matthew Leutwyler's horror movie about six young people trapped in a creepy small town goes for parody and fails. There is no suspense or real fun but tons of gore. (Anita Gates) 'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott) 'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Dana Stevens) * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis) '15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young non professional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens) * 'GUNNER PALACE' (PG-13, 86 minutes). Raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary about American soldiers in Iraq than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. (Scott) 'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott) 'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden) * 'HEAD-ON' (not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish). This film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of 2005. (Dargis) 'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott) 'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden) 'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott) 'IN MY COUNTRY' (R, 104 minutes). Juliette Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of this high-minded but hopelessly wooden film. (Holden) 'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' (NC-17, 90 minutes). A lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary about Linda Lovelace, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat.'' (Dargis) 'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis) 'THE JACKET' (R, 102 minutes). Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, who is sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. (Scott) 'KONTROLL' (R, 106 minutes; in Hungarian). Shot entirely in the Budapest subway system, Nimrod Antal's debut film is a grungy, shaggy-dog allegory -- a stylish, meandering trip to nowhere in particular. (Scott) 'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott) * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott) 'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott) * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott) * 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis) 'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis) 'MONDOVINO' (Not rated, 131 minutes). This documentary about the effects of globalization on the making and consumption of wine is full of beautiful landscapes and challenging ideas, but it is also repetitious, tendentious and much too long. (Scott) 'ODESSA ... ODESSA!' (not rated, 96 minutes). Most of the people who gather to reminisce and sing the old songs in this mournful, slowly paced cinematic poem are Jewish exiles from the decrepit Ukrainian city, which they remember as paradise. (Holden) 'OLD BOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge (Dargis). 'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel) 'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott) 'PERLASCA' (not rated, 104 minutes; in Italian). In Hungary in 1944, Giorgio Perlasca saved the lives of thousands of Jews, and his memory deserves better than this inept Italian television film. (Gates) 'THE RING TWO' (PG-13, 111 minutes). In ''The Ring,'' Rachel (Naomi Watts), a journalist and single mom, escaped the marauding ghost in the machine, and she now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements. (Dargis) 'RAGING DOVE' (not rated, 70 minutes). A bruising but illuminating documentary considers how nationalism flattened one young, sure-footed boxer, who was born in Nazareth to a Palestinian family. (Martel) 'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott) 'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden) 'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis) * 'SCHIZO' (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender. As the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story, it achieves a rough, convincing poetry. (Scott) 'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott) 'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis) 'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott) * 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens) 'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott) 'WINNING GIRLS THROUGH PSYCHIC MIND CONTROL' (not rated, 93 minutes). Sam (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) suddenly develops psychic powers in this likable but only sporadically funny comedy. (Gates) 'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens) Film Series 'DAVID CROSS SELECTS' (through Sunday). In a break from its usual highbrow lineup, the Anthology Film Archives offers a week's worth of films guest-curated by the comedian David Cross. One seldom-seen gem from his wildly eclectic list is ''Chilly Scenes of Winter,'' Joan Micklin Silver's 1979 adaptation of an Ann Beattie novel. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212)505-5181; $8.

By popular demand, Film Forum has rescheduled a one-day-only screening of the uncut version of ''Baby Face,'' the notorious 1933 film in which a young Barbara Stanwyck climbs the corporate ladder, one man at a time. This slightly longer (and much tawdrier) version will be followed by a screening of clips from the censored version, for comparison's sake. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8112; $10 (Stevens). 'THE 12TH NEW YORK AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL' (Wednesday through April 28). Along with a screening of last year's breakout hit ''Moolaade,'' this year's festival features ''Al'Leessi An African Actress,'' a documentary about the Nigerian actress Zalika Souley, who made her name in the 1960's playing bad-girl desperadoes in an atmosphere of strict Muslim repression. Walter Reade, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10. (Stevens) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ADULT (Thursday and next Friday).

(Ratliff) DAFNIS PRIETO ABSOLUTE QUINTET, (Tonight and tomorrow) This drummer's music is some of the best within New York's new Latin-jazz movement, distinguished by complex, jaggedly modern writing, but also by a deep cultural literacy of Cuban folklore; this new group includes the saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the pianist Jason Lindner, the violinist Alan Grubner and the cellist Catherine Bent. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15 per set.

(Ratliff) * CLARK TERRY QUINTET, (Tonight and tomorrow) It's possible that no other jazz musician has as much amusing old-guy charm as Mr. Terry, and when you think he's all sweetness, he'll rattle you profoundly with a cool, beautifully executed piece of fluegelhorn playing. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253; cover, $40.

(Ratliff) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Tonight, Monday, Thursday) There is less of Deborah Voigt than there has been for a long time, but the voice is as big and imposing as ever. 8 p.m. tonight, 7:30 Monday and Thursday, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $200. (Bernard Holland) 'THE BARTERED BRIDE' (Wednesday) Students at the Juilliard School hope to have a good time with Smetana's wonderful evocation of rural Central European life and music. 8 p.m., Juilliard Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Holland) 'CARMEN' (Sunday) Gary Thor Wedow conducts, John Bellemer is Don José and Katharine Goeldner sings the title role in Jonathan Eaton's handsome production of the Bizet favorite. (This is the final performance of the season.) 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, sold out but returns may be available. (Jeremy Eichler) 'LA FANCIULLA DEL WEST' (Tomorrow) Conventional wisdom has it that Puccini's Wild West opera doesn't have enough hit tunes; but the human awkwardness of its characters could be another reason it's not as popular as ''Tosca.'' But for this music, it's worth overlooking the singing Indians. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, $32 to $115. (Anne Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera has the starriest of casts for its new ''Faust,'' though Roberto Alagna sings opposite Soile Isokoski, the fine but rather cool Finnish soprano, rather than his wife and usual singing partner, Angela Gheorghiu. The role of Valentin may lie a bit high for the voice of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and surely there are better uses for René Pape's velvety bass, but these high-octane singers may blow away all doubts, especially with James Levine in the pit to help them. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. (Midgette) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The essentials of Puccini's opera -- the tragedy of a geisha who took her marriage to an American naval officer seriously when he didn't -- are well served by Mark Lamos's spare production at City Opera. The cast includes Marc Heller as Pinkerton and Jee Hyun Lim as Butterfly. Atsushi Yamada conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, (212)870-5570, $32 to $115. (Allan Kozinn) 'LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES' (Tonight) Zandra Rhodes's brightly colored sets in this new City Opera production evoke the opening ceremonies at an Olympic Games. The singing is O.K. but for all its beautiful music, this is an opera in which not much happens but takes a long time to do it. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570, sold out. (Midgette) 'TURANDOT' (Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to stage direction reaches its apotheosis with this opulent production, which by this point in the year has become somewhat routine. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $170. (Midgette) 'DIE WALKÜRE' (Tomorrow) For Met fans accustomed to James Levine's probing performances of Wagner, Valery Gergiev's approach to ''Die Walküre'' will seem a notable change: more rhapsodic, less structural, fleeter over all, though less sublime than Mr. Levine's at its best. The cast includes several fine singers from Mr. Gergiev's home company, the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. The tireless Plácido Domingo sings Siegmund. 12:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $40 to $215. (Anthony Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrow) Julie Taymor's new production of Mozart's fairy-tale opera ''Die Zauberflöte'' has proven a crowd pleaser. But the production is so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy, and so peopled with dancers, gargantuan puppets and kite-like animals of every sort that the fine musical performances take a back seat to the stage show. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. (Tommasini) Classical Music AUGUSTUS ARNONE (Thursday) An obviously brave young pianist tackles music to perk up the ears, by Debussy, Elliott Carter, David Rakowski and Roberto Sierra. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $12.

(Tommasini) CHANTICLEER (Tonight) This remarkable all-male, 12-voice a cappella choir turns its attention to the opposite sex tonight at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Titled ''Women, Saintly and Otherwise,'' the program of works from the Renaissance (Josquin and Victoria) to the 20th century (Poulenc) is described as a ''tribute to woman as ruler, composer, muse and creator.'' 8 p.m., Temple of Dendur, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949, sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.

(Oestreich) EMPIRE VIOLS (Tonight) It's a groaner of a pun, ''Senfl Pleasures,'' but if that's what it takes to get music of Ludwig Senfl (not to mention Andreas Hammerschmidt and David Funck) on the boards, so be it. 8 p.m., Second Presbyterian Church, 6 West 96th Street, (917)363-2646, $10. (Oestreich) BRIAN FERNEYHOUGH (Tonight) This British composer applies his spiky, intensely focused style to Piranesi's eerie ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' engravings in a chamber work of the same name that may be a quirkily twisted ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' for our time. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799, $20. (Kozinn) JOSE FRANCH-BALLESTER (Tuesday) This Spanish clarinetist, born in 1980, has already won more awards and competitions than any young artist could hope for, including the First Prize in the 2004 Young Concert Artists International Auditions. That invaluable organization presents this promising new artist in an adventurous recital of works by Messager, Chausson, Brahms, Bassi and Kenji Bunch. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, at Lexington Avenue, (212)307-6656, $20 and $30.

(Kozinn) JENNIFER KOH (Thursday) She's a fiery young violinist with a special flare for contemporary music. For this recital, she plays works by Esa-Pekka Salonen and John Adams contrasted with music by Schumann, Schubert and Ravel. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949, $20, $10 for students. (Eichler) ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) The pianist and musicologist wears both hats at once in his ''Mozart Explained'' series of concerts with commentary. Malcolm Bilson joins him here for two-piano as well as four-hand works, including Mr. Levin's own completion of a Mozart fragment for two pianos. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $25. (Eichler) BRUCE LEVINGSTON (Monday) Chuck Close's portrait of Philip Glass has become one of the best-known images of the composer; now Mr. Glass repays the favor with ''A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close,'' the opener of Bruce Levingston's piano recital, which it shares with music by Brahms, Schumann, Debussy, Liszt and Messiaen. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $25 to $150.

(Kozinn) 'MOVING PATTERNS: ELECTRONIC MUSIC AND BEYOND' (Tuesday through next Saturday) It has been a long way from the 1960's, when electronic works were collections of pings, bops and buzzes. This festival of recent Austrian works takes in pieces that draw on everything from the eerie sound of the theremin to up-to-date computer scores and film soundtracks. Tuesday at 7:15 p.m.; Wednesday, Friday and next Saturday at 7 p.m.; Thursday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)319 5300, free.

Museums AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times are used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. The show is a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions: how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. Central Park West at 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Grace Glueck) * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India, embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism.

More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments and represents 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith). COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck) DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'FIRST SEEN: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES, 1840-1880,' through May 1. About 250 pictures from the vast archives of the Wilson Center for Photography in London depict ''first'' glimpses of people, rather than the more usual landscapes, mountains or relics that were easier subjects for the pioneer cameras. The profusion can cause the viewer's mind to boggle, but it gives a good idea of the worldwide sweep of the earliest camera lens. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212)759-0606. (Glueck) * 'SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' through May 11.

(Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above) (Cotter) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' through May 1. Fra Carnevale is known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both are in this intricate show, which shows his paintings with some by figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca to explore ideas about professional identity in a diverse cultural epoch. (See above.) (Cotter). * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30: A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman). * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman). NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through May 8. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith). NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck). NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers, among them Lotte Jacobi, Josef Albers, Gisele Freund, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and August Sander. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck). P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman) THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of a community museum begun in 1976. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, (212)228-0110. (Glueck) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through May 8. Despite the title, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Cotter) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. (See above.) (Kimmelman). WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE' Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragicomic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. (Johnson) * WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street 'IN BLACK AND WHITE' This ecumenical group show follows its color scheme across the party lines separating generations, mediums, styles and cliques. Among the standouts is an unusually de Kooning-like 1950's oil-on-board by Ad Reinhardt and an assertive bust of a woman by Louisa Matthiasdottir. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212)750-0949, through April 29. (Smith) LARRY BURROWS ''War and Peace,'' Before he was lost in a helicopter over Laos in 1971, Burrows produced images in Vietnam that are among the most beautiful and moving war photographs made. This selection of 27 pictures includes a number of those, as well as more conventional news photographs. Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-3930, through April 30. (Johnson) 'SERIOUS NONSENSE: THE IMAGERY OF BRUCE McCALL' If Fred Astaire had made paintings in his spare time, perhaps they would have looked like the smooth and witty, 1940's-style gouaches of Mr. McCall, a contributor to The New Yorker and other magazines. James Goodman, 41 East 57th Street, (212)593-3737, through April 30. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'HAVING DIFFERENCES' A lively selection of seven young Los Angeles artists, includes Jacob Melchi's hilarious, hand-printed stories about art world people; Eduardo Sarabia's fake ''stolen'' vases; and Marie Jager's zany android movie. I-20, 529 West 20th Street, (212)645-1100, through April 30. (Johnson) 'IAN KIAER: THE GREY CLOTH' Five installation pieces work as a neurasthenic environment whose pale monochromes and found objects abjectly elegize the building blocks of modernism. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery 521 West 21st Street, (212)414-4144, through April 30. (Smith) 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: SELF-PORTRAITS' A bracing display of ambitious, self-deprecating and in some ways tragic self-portraits rarely seen in the United States, by the German bad-boy artist whose reputation and influence have been expanding since his death in 1997. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212)206-9100, through April 30. (Smith) 'JUTTA KOETHER' A small survey of a German-born New York painter whose graffiti-inspired brushwork, fluorescent palette, fragmented images and heavy-duty quotations define her medium as defiantly multipurpose. It provides pleasure, incites thought and questions assumptions about taste and technique. Thomas Erben, 516 West 20th Street, (212)645-8701, through May 7. (Smith) JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE' This retrospective sampler of a revered member of the New York avant-garde film community presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the last five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through May 14. (Johnson) DAVID RATCLIFF Digitally processed montages of mass-media imagery are converted into hand-cut stencils, to create hallucinatory, two-tone spray paintings, finessing the gap between Pop and Surrealism. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through May 7. (Johnson) ANGELA STRASSHEIM: 'LEFT BEHIND' The large, extraordinarily vivid color photographs in this New York solo debut have a subtly gripping archetypal magic. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212)627-3363, through April 30. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of the legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, through May 28. (Glueck) MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, which has meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith) JEFF HAND, 'THE SHADOW OF DOUBT' This Nashville conceptualist's comic art-about-art includes a de Kooning ''Woman'' remade from carpet scraps; a Motherwell bathmat; and a revolving, fur-lined teacup. Plus Ultra, 235 South First Street, Williamsburg, (718)387-3844, through April 25. (Johnson) MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, SYROS, PARIS BAR, AND DAWSON CITY' Concentrating on far-flung earthworks commissioned by the owners of a Berlin art bar named for the French capital, this exhibition corrals many of the German artist's so-called side lines, including drawings and watercolors. They capture quite a bit of his raucous, free-range sensibility. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, 8D, (212)473-4447, through April 30. (Smith) 'JOSHUA SMITH: MAKE IT PLAIN' Smart yet homey, subversive yet beautiful, Mr. Smith's second solo show combines formerly busy canvases revised into busily bordered gray monochromes and a sea of bar stools arted-up with similarly nonchalant flair. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)477-5006, through April 29. (Smith) JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style. City Hall Park, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson) Last Chance NORMAN BLUHM A second-generation Abstract Expressionist who tended to dismiss the designation, Bluhm (1921-99) still held on to the sweeping ''gestural'' painting. He was a painter to reckon with: unfazed by styles or trends, he did it his way. James Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212)535-5767, closing tomorrow. (Glueck) SYDNEY BLUM, ''Undoing.'' File these elegant, ethereal wall pieces, made of tangles of thin wire variously colored, bent, crinkled and coiled, under the heading of art that looks easy but isn't. Kim Foster, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)229-0044, closing tomorrow. (Smith) ERIC FISCHL Paintings based on his own photographs of hired models behaving like jaded sophisticates. They are suavely made with wide brushes in muted colors, but a frustrating vagueness limits the psychological intrigue. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)752-2929, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM, CAMBRIDGE' The Frick's third show devoted to small bronze sculptures continues to enhance the notion that mini-bronzes are as rewarding as large-scale sculpture. Though small, they have the charge of life-size works. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700, closing on Sunday. (Glueck) JOE FYFE, ''Paintings From Vietnam.'' Mr. Fyfe, an art critic and painter, made the almost purely abstract paintings in this small show in Vietnam last year. They are rough and reticent yet somehow delicately poetic, too. JG Contemporary, 505 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)564-7662, closing tomorrow (Johnson). ROBERT GOBER Mr. Gober turns the Matthew Marks space into a kind of church, with a suspended crucifix, inaccessible side chapels and intimations of a priest. Facsimiles of The New York Times add the Clinton years and 9/11 to his perennial themes of life and death, sin and redemption. It's iconography with an old-fashioned moral vehemence, combining the hermetic with the familiar in mind-twisting ways. 522 West 22nd Street, (212)243-0200, closing tomorrow. (Smith) MARK HEYER Mr. Heyer's small, folksy narrative paintings of subjects like a tornado approaching a Midwestern farm look as if they were made by a simple-minded colleague of Edward Hopper and Charles Burchfield. That they are actually clever Postmodernist simulations does not prevent them from being nostalgically enchanting. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)675-2656, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) ELLSWORTH KELLY: 'SMALL PAINTINGS, 1955- 63,' A gem of an exhibition presents seven small paintings from a formative period in the career of one of our most celebrated abstractionists. Mr. Kelly's subtly witty, formally acute play with simple shapes, the picture plane and primary colors gives these works a punchy vitality. Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)966-5154, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: DEAR PAINTER, PAINT FOR ME' After John Baldessari, but before Damien Hirst, Kippenberger hired a commercial artist to make photorealist paintings, which are personalized by their quirky compositions and his frequent presence. They have never been shown together in New York. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212)744-2313, closing tomorrow. (Smith) 'MODEL MODERNISMS' This smart show of wry and oblique takes on Modernism includes driftwood sculptures by Carol Bove and a haunting video by Florian Pumhosl whose climax is a close-up of a Cyclops quietly peeling an apple. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)226-3970, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION' The most visionary museum of the 20th century inaugurates its temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep it from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. (See above.) Closing on Monday. (Smith) GONZALO PUCH: 'INCIDENTES' Five metaphysical C-print photographs seem to comment ironically on science, art, their ambitions and intersections. The punchiest shows the artist on the floor, his mouth affixed to a tube. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing tomorrow (Glueck). HERVÉ DI ROSA: 'THE SOLO GROUP SHOW' A French Neo-Popster presents more than 500 small paintings and drawings in four clusters. The gleeful irreverence and love of absurdity holds it all together that wins you over. Haim Chanin, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (646)230-7200, closing tomorrow (Johnson). ALEXANDER ROSS Mr. Ross's funny, weird, Pop-Surrealist paintings look like the work of a nerdy teenager steeped in science fiction and cannabis. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)675-7772, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) ZULMA STEELE AND ARTHUR WESLEY DOW There's a mismatch of talents here. In this show of their landscapes, she is far outclassed by him. Spanierman Gallery, 45 East 58th Street, (212)832-0208, closing tomorrow. (Glueck) MAGNUS VON PLESSEN In his eagerness to suggest fluctuating moods and rapid shifting of perceptions, he puts down fugitive images done in by paint or the lack of it. Paint, or its strategic omission, the artist seems to say, trumps imagery. In more talented hands, this is often true, but not here. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)",4fd25dfe8eb7c8105d80cec0,15703

Broadway ++'BROOKLYN BOY' One of the mortifications of middle age is being forced to admit the truth in those extra-mossy clichés that you mock when you are young and arrogant. The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79. BEN BRANTLEY +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything in this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show. BRANTLEY +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of this old Elmer Rice drama. Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the show. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 'HAPPY DAYS' In this ill-conceived production, the comic Lea DeLaria rampages through the central role of one of Samuel Beckett's eloquently bleak masterworks. ''Happy Days'' is admittedly an acting challenge of a rare order, but Ms. DeLaria doesn't really even attempt it. Instead of inhabiting the play's indomitable central character, she simply recycles her natural comic persona, turning a potentially heartbreaking woman into a belligerent stand-up comic. Alternately racing through Beckett's dialogue or stretching it out needlessly, Ms. DeLaria grimaces and mugs, flaps her arms, tries out a half-dozen different funny voices. The endless activity is a sure indication that Ms. DeLaria either doubts her own ability to hold the audience's attention in the role, or doesn't trust Beckett's writing to do the same. (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $45 to $50. CHARLES ISHERWOOD * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffman's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories from the mid-19th century, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest. Directed by Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, and featuring bizarrely beautiful songs by Martyn Jacques, ''Shockheaded Peter'' manages to wallow in and tear apart our enduring appetite for scaring ourselves. Though styled as a Victorian peep show, this British import makes contemporary self-spoofing horror exercises (like Wes Craven's ''Scream'' movies) look like, well, child's play (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 10 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $21.25 to $66.24. BRANTLEY 'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance. PHOEBE HOBAN * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45. ISHERWOOD * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies ''Waiting for Guffman'' and ''Best in Show'' -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on ''Falsettos,'' is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75. ISHERWOOD +'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get In the case of ''The Musical of Musicals!'' Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell. (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kander and Ebb. The best parodists don't sneer, they tease, and share the form's joie de vivre.'' Aficianados will get every joke and neophytes will laugh too. ''The Musical of Musicals!'' creates its own lightly absurd world (90 minutes). Dodger Stages, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 4 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $59.50. MARGO JEFFERSON Off Off Broadway 'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. In fiction, they too often seem like a cheap gimmick. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $19. NEIL GENZLINGER Last Chance 'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON 'A CLOCKWORK ORANGE' When Stanley Kubrick made his 1971 film adaptation of Anthony Burgess's sci-fi novella ''A Clockwork Orange,'' he left out the sunny final chapter in which Alex, the ultra-violent gang member, abandons his reckless youth and dreams of kids and a family. Burgess, who hated the film, put this coda back in his theatrical adaptation, proving that playwrights aren't always their own best critics. Joe Tantalo's purposeless production of ''Clockwork Orange'' never escapes the shadow of the iconic film. Randy Falcon, who plays Alex, doesn't bring the personality of a leading man, and in some ways, that's O.K. In the film, Alex's eye had a mischievous twinkle, but, here, it's glassy and expressionless -- a window into nothing in particular (1:20). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212279-4200. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets $25, $15 student rush tickets available on day of performance. JASON ZINOMAN 'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, ''Learn to use explosives.'' When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. . Tickets: $15. GENZLINGER 'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Ashlie Atkinson as the overweight woman a rising executive falls for (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50. BRANTLEY 'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a ''Thalidomide baby,'' stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant, but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clichéd. (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15. ISHERWOOD 'LEARNING CURVE' Rogelio Martinez's play gets off to a promising start but never quite arrives. The recipe for this civil-rights soufflé has all the right ingredients -- an interesting premise, intelligent writing and several noteworthy performances -- but in the end it falls flat. The play, which jumps somewhat confusingly between past and present, revolves around the interracial relationship of David, a black freshman, and Sally, a white junior with a tenured-professor father at an unnamed Ivy League college. There are further complications when Sally exhibits controversial photographs she's taken of David, climaxing in the 1968 armed takeover of a campus building by African-American students. Loosely based on a real-life event at Cornell, ''Learning Curve'' examines racism, the white academic patriarchy and the double-edged sword of affirmative action (2:10). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15. HOBAN 'A LIFE A BROAD (MI VIDA EN JIRA)' Melanie Rey has a big bright voice, and her one-woman show is a musical. She style-surfs through multiple styles in English and Spanish: ballads, Anglo rock, R&B and Tex-Mex. She is an accomplished actor too, but the word ''accomplished'' often means that an actor with all the right moves shows them all too predictably. A one-person 90-minute show needs more. Ms. Rey's real talent comes through unstrained when she plays her passionate, husband-hunting mother. When she plays herself, she is working too hard to win our love (1:30). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, at Charlton Street, South Village, (212) 252-2439. Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m.; Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $30. JEFFERSON 'THE SECRET NARRATIVE OF THE PHONE BOOK' Spouting cascades of words, like fireboats expelling water in a harbor parade, the four actors in Gordon Cox's satiric new play manage to keep the pressure high for the first half of the evening's 90 minutes. It's a feat, because the self-described ''romantic comedy hijacked by a conspiracy thriller'' ultimately falls victim to overearnest lecturing and a convoluted plot about media control by a Big Brother phone company. Still, the fact that Mr. Cox, a theater critic for Newsday, obviously loves language, makes the early scenes a kick to hear (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3. Tickets: $15; $8 for students. ANDREA STEVENS +'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British ''Sleeping Beauty'' to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30. ISHERWOOD 'YOKASTAS REDUX' When Richard Schechner, the founding director of the Performance Group, realized that just one major female figure in Greek mythology did not have a play of her own, he decided to create one. With the Romanian writer Saviana Stanescu, he has created this mostly fascinating retelling of the Oedipus story from the perspective of the woman who marries and bears children with her first-born son. The conventions of postmodern theater are all here but are used with unexpected power and wit. Like the carnal relation at its center, this play is tender, pornographic, antic and intensely compelling (1:50). La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, (212)475-7710. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $15. MIRIAMHORN Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world. MANOHLA DARGIS 'BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE' Starring Annasophia Robb and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Wayne Wang. (PG, 97 minutes) Were it not for a couple of cars, a little girl's pink poodle backpack and a reference to e-Bay, Wayne Wang's ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' could easily be mistaken for a film set in the 1950's. It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. Adapted from Kate DiCamillo's best-selling children's novel, this is the story of Opal Buloni (Ms. Robb), a very lonely 10-year-old since she and her father (Mr. Daniels), a minister, have moved to Naomi, Fla., a town so small (or odd) that church services are held in a convenience store. So when Opal sees a scruffy dog loose in a Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, she claims him, names him for the place where they met and takes him home. Once Opal has Winn-Dixie at her side, she makes new friends easily. This is a harmless, pleasant comic drama, but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric in print take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film. Sometimes you can't tell the magic realism from the corn. ANITA GATES 'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie. GATES 'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was ''Bend It Like Beckham'' -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: ''Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.'' Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with cliché as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think ''My Big Fat Sari Wedding'' tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert). DARGIS 'CONSTANTINE' Starring Keanu Reeves. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Mr. Reeves glowers his way through another effect-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. He is John Constantine, who travels back and forth between our world and the one below, working as a kind of free-lance border guard, sending stray demons back into the fiery depths (where they appear to have cars). But something big is brewing, involving rebel angels, the son of Satan, and a whole lot of pseudo-biblical mumbo-jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose sister has jumped off a roof, and Shia LeBoeuf as an eager dabbler in the occult. Tilda Swinton is the angel Gabriel, doing a bit of slumming after boffo work in Milton's ''Paradise Lost.'' A.O. SCOTT 'DOWNFALL' Starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (No rating, 155 minutes; in German, with English subtitles). Mr. Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses around him and the Red Army closes in. Surrounding him are his followers, some fanatically loyal, others wavering in the face of defeat, who must all play out the endgame of their ghastly world-historical project. Mr. Hirschsbiegel's film, taking place at the moment when the energies of Nazism turned from murder to suicide, is engrossing and well made, but it does not generate much feeling beyond a queasy, prurient fascination. Its most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. Those who turn away from Hitler at the bitter end are restored to innocence, when in fact they were loyal Nazis whose convenient disillusionment -- coming as Russian soldiers appeared over the horizon -- is treated as a heroic exercise of conscience. SCOTT 'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, and Amy Irving. . Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In this downbeat, sufficiently unsettling film, Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors. DARGIS 'HITCH' Starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valetta. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Mr. Smith as a dating coach who helps hapless Manhattan men snag women much better looking than they are. His own head is turned by Ms. Mendes, playing surely the most kindly gossip columnist ever to grace the pages of a New York tabloid. Complications, as always, ensue, but nothing too challenging or painful, either for the central couple or for the audience. Mr. James, best known as the portly King of Queens on television, is around for comic relief as an especially needy client, who is smitten with the willowy Ms. Valletta. SCOTT 'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (NC-17, 90 minutes). It was the image seen -- cheered and jeered, canonized and demonized -- around the world. In 1972 Linda Lovelace, nee Linda Boreman, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat,'' played the role that would bequeath on her a tawdry and lasting celebrity. With a single act of extreme fellatio, this dazed and often confused 23-year-old became a pinup for the party animal's sexual revolution and, in time, a martyr in the crusade against pornography. But as is clear from this lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary, Ms. Boreman was also little more than a pawn, an empty vessel for opportunists from both sides of the pornography divide. The documentary is a ''slam, bam, thank you, ma'am'' trifle of an entertainment, one strategically packaged for Generation A.D.D. DARGIS * 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center. SCOTT * 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. SCOTT * 'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters. SCOTT 'ONG BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR' Starring Tony Jaa. Directed by Prachya Pinkaew (R, 101 minutes; in Thai, with English subtitles). Martial arts for purists who disdain wirework, computer-generated imagery and digital tweaking. Ting (Mr. Jaa) a country bumpkin trained in the deadly art of Thai Muay, travels to Bangkok to retrieve the stolen head of his village Buddha. Once there, his peaceful disposition is challenged by all manner of thugs and lowlifes. The story is beside the point: like the low-budget Hong Kong action pictures of the 1970's, this movie offers scrappy, ingenious fight choreography. The director is so enamored of some sequences that he treats himself -- and the audience -- to instant replays. SCOTT 'POOH'S HEFFALUMP MOVIE' With the voices of Jim Cummings, John Fiedler and Kyle Stanger. Directed by Frank Nissen. (G, 63 minutes). In A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh with a honey jar stuck on his head. In this adorable animated film, he and the other animals finally encounter the real thing. And it (Lumpy the baby heffalump) is too cute for words, largely thanks to the endearing voice and infectious laugh of 8-year-old Kyle Stanger. The plot involves Roo capturing Lumpy (who thinks a visit to the Roo's part of Hundred Acre Wood sounds like a fine game) and Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore and company learning that Heffalumps aren't scary at all. There is a dash of child-pleasing animated slapstick, a few nice Carly Simon songs and a crucial lesson about the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you. GATES 'SON OF THE MASK' Starring Jamie Kennedy. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. (PG, 86 minutes) Tim Avery (Mr. Kennedy) is a would-be cartoonist and full-time schlemiel, stuck at a low-level job at a cutting-edge animation company. Tim chances upon a wooden mask that his dog Otis dragged home. As viewers of the original 1994 film ''The Mask'' will know, this artifact is the property of Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Whoever dons it immediately becomes a computer-animated whirlwind of obnoxious egotism and untrammeled desire. In short order, Tim has gotten himself promoted at the company and impregnated his wife (Traylor Howard). But alas, their son Alvy is ''born of the Mask'' -- he's a semi-digitized superbaby, capable of shape-shifting, tap-dancing, and feats of superhuman strength. When Loki (Alan Cumming) decides to come back for his mask, Tim is in for a roller-coaster ride of manic chase scenes and computer-assisted mayhem. Youngsters will suffer no lasting harm from this frantic, grating spectacle, but their less resilient parents may not be so lucky. DANA STEVENS 'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner (PG-13, 90 minutes). Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of ''Pretty Woman,'' the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. ''The Wedding Date'' proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness. GATES Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. JIMMY BOSCH AND FRIENDS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street (212) 576-1155. Jimmy Bosch is a trombonist who savors the Latin jazz tradition of the descarga, a jam session everyone can dance to. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $15 with a one drink minimum. JON PARELES RYAN CABRERA, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. This singer gestures toward just about every genre that's available to a sensitive boy: emo, teen-pop, mainstream rock, folk. (Give him a few years and he may be making overtures to the indie-rock world, too.) Despite all that, he remains best known for being Ashlee Simpson's (on again? off again?) boyfriend, which should earn him no sympathy -- there are far worse ways to be known, after all. Tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8, with Aslyn and Kyle Riabko; tickets are $29.50 in advance, $30 at the door. KELEFA SANNEH CHEVELLE/HELMET, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. The muscular despair of grunge and the desolate, sinewy ballads of Tool live on in the grim, down-tuned, power-chorded dirges of Chevelle. Sharing the bill is the long-running New York band Helmet, a 1990's pioneer of sparse, deliberate, misanthropic hard rock. They're headlining the Snocore tour, which also includes the hard-rock bands Crossfade, Future Leaders of the World and Strata. Tonight at 6; tickets are $25. PARELES CONJUNTO CLÁSICO, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-2672. The classic part of Conjunto Clásico is its lineup of trumpets, percussion and the sharp delicacy of a tres guitar, playing time-tested styles like the Cuban son and the Puerto Rican bomba. But there's nothing old-fashioned about the momentum it generates on the dance floor. It shares the bill with an all-star Dominican band that includes Victor Roque, Patrick Shannon, Kaky Vargas, Tonny Tun Tun, Raffy Matias and Henry Hierro and with Jovanny Polanco. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $20. PARELES * EDAN, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)414-4245. This playful and verbose white rapper and DJ comes to APT for a DJ set celebrating his forthcoming album, ''Beauty and the Beat'' (Lewis). Expect a set full of old-fashioned, relentlessly propulsive hip-hop -- this is a guy who once compiled his favorite motormouths on a mixtape entitled, ''Fast Rap.'' Tonight after 10, with Chairman Mao; admission is $5. SANNEH * JACOB FRED JAZZ ODYSSEY, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. This keyboards-bass-drums trio from Tulsa (including no one named Jacob Fred) has been playing the jam-band circuit with music that stretches from funk to the further reaches of abstraction. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $12. PARELES KID606, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Riving Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. The producer and DJ who calls himself Kid 606 made his name by making dance music punkier, adding noise and speed until his beats rushed by in a staticky blur. Oddly enough, this deafening but rather dull approach earned him an enthusiastic fan base, though he's recently been experimenting with other (perhaps more interesting) ideas. At this party, he is to spin a set of acid house -- a low-concept plan, and an appealing one. Tonight at 10, with the DFA-affiliated group Pixeltan (including Hisham Bharoocha, formerly of Black Dice) and Tommie Sunshine; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 at the door. SANNEH * JON LANGFORD, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. When he's not singing with the Mekons, the pioneering punk band that also savors the directness of country and gospel, Jon Langford spins off side projects, bawling his way through songs full of history, surrealism and twang. Tonight at 9:30; tickets are $15. PARELES LONGWAVE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Longwave's songs ponder self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. Tonight at 9; admission is $10. PARELES * MASCOTT/IDA/ANTIETAM, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Kendall Jane Meade, the songwriter and singer behind Mascott, wraps vulnerability and longing in quietly radiant pop songs, with a calm, pensive voice that suggests a less cynical Aimee Mann. The three-member band Ida has just released a new album, ''Heart Like a River'' (Polyvinyl), that brings serene harmonies to songs about longtime love as well as romances that don't go so smoothly. Antietam, from Louisville, Ky., has been playing lean, forthright indie-rock since the 1980's. Sunday night at 8; admission is $10. PARELES JAMES McMURTRY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. James McMurtry packs a lot of story into his low-key songs: tales of loners and losers adrift in wide-open spaces. His voice is deadpan, but his characters survive grand struggles. Tomorrow night at 7:30; admission is $15. PARELES MURK, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Murk is the Miami-based duo of Oscar G. and Ralph Falcon, who excel at producing and spinning thick, hazy dance tracks that ooze and evolve, occasionally making way for snippets of euphoric vocals. They've done some of their best work on remixes, and they recently turned Yoko Ono's ''Everyman Has a Woman Who Loves Him'' into a woozy, frenetic rhythm experiment, with Ms. Ono's vocals mainly submerged beneath synthesizer snarls and air-raid sirens. Tonight after 10; tickets are $15 in advance, expect to pay more at the door. SANNEH * ONEIDA, 150 Attorney Street at Stanton Street, (212)388-0077. Oneida, a New York band, leans hard on the keyboard-driven minimal rock of the early 1980's for songs that are joyfully relentless. It revs up frantic, obsessive patterns to carry thoughts about history, sex, drugs, rock and roll and a dystopian future, with a drive that's both obsessive and ecstatic. Tonight at 11, with the Apes at 10, Wilderness at 9 and New Beirut Holiday at 8; admission is $10. PARELES * OTEP, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. The new Otep album is ''House of Secrets'' (Capitol), an appealing mishmash of over-the-top goth imagery (is there any other kind?) and furious dynamic shifts. Otep Shamaya and her band spend more time holding back, letting listeners anticipate the inevitable arrival of yet another brutal noise-metal climax. As you might have guessed, this isn't a band that takes care to avoid the ridiculous -- for starters, the album art is in goofy 3-D, and to read it you'll need to use the two halves of the red-and-blue plastic case. But the best songs find intriguing (though never subtle) ways to evoke abuse, capturing victims and perpetrators at both their clammy quietest and their raging loudest. Tonight at 8, with American Head Charge, Candiria and Blood Simple; tickets are $17. SANNEH PEPPER, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800 and the Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732)502-0600. For those who miss the easygoing but mildly despairing reggae-rock of Sublime, along comes Pepper, a band from Hawaii that almost uncannily replicates both the sound and the attitude. At Irving Plaza tonight at 8; tickets are $18. At the Stone Pony tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $13. PARELES RACHEL'S, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700 and Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. The songs of Rachel's, a band from Louisville, Ky., are as close to chamber music as to pop, looking inward with pensive songs and transparent compositions tinged with Minimalism; yes, a cello is involved. At Mercury Lounge tonight at 10:30, with Invert at 9:30 and Kevin Devine at 8:30; admission is $17. At Northsix tomorrow night at 9, with Invert and Chris Brokaw opening; admission is $17. PARELES * STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street. (212)576-1155. The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes and can play them in traditional style, but it's not afraid of swamp-rock or a touch of country either. This event starts with dance lessons Sunday at 1:30, with the band at 2:30; admission is $22 with a one drink minimum. PARELES * SAMMY DEE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Like many of Germany's most appealing D.J.'s, Sammy Dee loves to find out how much you can eliminate from dance music before it's no longer danceable. He's affiliated with the puckish electronic label Perlon, which has inspired a devoted American cult. (For an introduction, seek out the label's extraordinary 2001 double-CD compilation ''Superlongevity,'' which is full of hiccupping minimalist dance tracks and hazy scrambled sound effects.) He's also half of the duo Pantytec, known for building austere but off-kilter beats out of throwaway sounds: crackling static, echoing wrong notes, tiny vocal snippets. Tonight after 10, with Plexus, Shawn Rudiman, Jwan Allen, Lukas Owens, Adam Ratana and Unjust; admission is $5. SANNEH ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local D.J. and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a ''Grammy-winning D.J.,'' although that title seems like faint praise. Last year he issued ''Release Yourself Vol. 3'' (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, ''The Love You Bring Me.'' Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, more at the door. SANNEH SI SÉ, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Si Sé is a multiple-identity New York band, formed by a singer, Carol C, and a keyboardist-disc jockey-programmer, Cliff Cristafaro, plus a pair of viola players and rhythm section. Its songs touch down variously in downtempo Sade territory, pop-flamenco, reggae, trance, drum-and-bass or various Latin hybrids. Tonight at 10; admission is $15 with a one drink minimum. PARELES * TASTE OF CHAOS TOUR, Asbury Park Convention Hall, 1300 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732)775-3533. This smartly organized national tour stakes out some middle ground between the punk-rock Warped Tour and the heavy-metal festival Ozzfest, bringing together some of the loudest, screaming-est, metal-est bands associated with the plaintive punk subgenre known as emo. The headliners include My Chemical Romance, which specializes in grand, twitchy, half-sarcastic break-up songs; the metal band Killswitch Engage, which hides heart-on-sleeve lyrics behind a furious, propulsive racket; and the wildly entertaining Utah band the Used, known for hair-trigger love songs that keep devolving into -- what else? -- chaos. (Visit www.tasteofchaos.com for the full line-up.) Tomorrow afternoon at 5 and Sunday afternoon (without My Chemical Romance) at 3; tickets are $25. SANNEH BALLA TOUNKARA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Balla Tounkara, a griot from Mali, plays the kora and leads a band that mixes African, American and Caribbean styles. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $20 with a one drink minimum. PARELES Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and last performance, Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50 tonight and tomorrow; $35 on Sunday; no minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. HOLDEN UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through next weekend, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum. HOLDEN * 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum. HOLDEN Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. J.D. ALLEN TRIO PLAYS THE MUSIC OF BUTCH MORRIS, Louis 649, 649 East Ninth Street, East Village, (212)673-1190. J.D. Allen, a young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Orrin Evans and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's monthlong ''Black February'' series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio, including Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8 pm; cover, $1. BEN RATLIFF JOHN BENITEZ QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. The Puerto Rican bassist John Benitez has become one of the most valuable parts of the new Latin-jazz scene in New York; he has recently been seen leading a number of different bands, and this is yet another. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15. RATLIFF JIMMY COBB'S MOB, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. One of the original hard-bop drummers and the only surviving musician from Miles Davis's ''Kind of Blue'' sessions, Jimmy Cobb plays hard-edged, straight-ahead jazz with his own quintet, Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25, $10 drink minimum. RATLIFF LOU DONALDSON QUARTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080. A prince of blues and bop, Mr. Donaldson is a saxophonist who reminds you of the earthiness inside jazz. He is also a wild, funny character who always plays better than you expect on an average night. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30, $10 food or drink minimum at a table. RATLIFF * KENNY GARRETT QUARTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212) 582-2121. You don't get much more of a body blow from modern mainstream jazz; this band is a study in impact. The alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett is fast and harmonically astute, but he is also a player of real power. He has been changing the band over the last few years, adding new young players; the new edition includes the pianist Vernell Brown, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Ronald Brunner. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 food or drink minimum. RATLIFF * JIM HALL QUARTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. There are few more self-effacing players at Jim Hall's level in jazz; he plays as if he could ditch it all tomorrow and never think about it again, but that is part of what makes him so important. His own compositions are sweet, oddball, sectional, played with extreme dynamics against lithe, swinging accompaniment, and his versions of standards can be subtly breathtaking, using light blues and country phrases. He is seriously open-minded, yet he does not razz popular music or pull anybody's leg, and his trail of accomplishments speaks for itself: his late-50's stint in Jimmy Giuffre's trio, his playing with Sonny Rollins and Art Farmer and a recent, late-blooming explosion as a composer and arranger. His most recent release is ''Magic Meeting,'' a live recording by his trio, but here he teams up with a quartet including Greg Osby, the alto saxophonist, as well as the bassist Steve Laspina and the drummer Kenny Wolleson. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, $10 minimum at a table, $5 at the bar. RATLIFF * LINCOLN CENTER JAZZ ORCHESTRA: 'FULL STEAM AHEAD,' Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, 5th Floor, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. Jazz at Lincoln Center's repertory programs --whether based on a composer or a theme -- are, to a certain way of thinking, their best. This weekend's shows selects songs about trains from the band-books of Ellington and Strayhorn, Mulligan, and the orchestra's leader, Wynton Marsalis, among others; expect a solid show, and a band that can bring colors out in familiar music that you can't hear on a recording. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 to $150, seating is extremely limited so reservations are strongly suggested. RATLIFF JUNIOR MANCE TRIO, Kitano hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7000. Now in his mid-70's, Junior Mance is an excitable, physical pianist who throws himself into fast tempos and long up-the-keyboard rolls that aren't heard much outside Oscar Peterson. But he is also an earthy blues and bop player from Chicago; his résumé includes time spent in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, plus a $10 minimum RATLIFF * MANHATTAN QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. A new and excellent-looking consortium for straight-ahead jazz, this group brings together musicians in their 30's and musicians in their 70's: the young tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz, the pianist Cyrus Chestnut, the bassist Goerge Mraz, and the drummer Ben Riley. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and $25 on Sunday. RATLIFF * BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; www.zebuloncafeconcert.com; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it ''Black February,'' and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's ''conductions,'' performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. It's fun to watch, and he has a strong sense of humor and beauty. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free; with the Butch Morris Emyoueseyesee Ensemble tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances. RATLIFF * EDDIE PALMIERI, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Mr. Palmieri is an excitable pianist, given to outré fantasias and pulverizing percussive lines. He has to rein in some of his more florid, mad-professor tendencies with the music of his old band, Conjunto la Perfecta, which is tight and hard and was originally created for the dancers at the old Palladium ballroom in the mid-1960's. He calls it La Perfecta II and it's mostly a repertory project, but the music sounds as alive as it did the day it was born. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30, $5 minimum. RATLIFF JEREMY PELT QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Jeremy Pelt is an impressive, forthright young trumpeter who has taken bits and pieces of style from Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard and others. But he frequently manages to get at the thing about jazz that transcends the matter of influences: though he might raid past players for their musical grammar, swing is personal, and Mr. Pelt wants to reveal its mystical properties, its feeling of floating. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' Puccini's opera lies at the intersection of tragedy and soap opera, and nobody even cares if the sets in Giancarlo del Monaco's Metropolitan Opera production make logical sense as long as there are lots of cherry blossoms to applaud. The three principals in this weekend's performance -- the last Met ''Butterfly'' of the season - can all hit the notes, some of them rather loudly: both Marco Berti, the Pinkerton, and Vassily Gerello, the Sharpless, are power singers who offer volume if not always finesse. Kallen Esperian, as Cio-Cio-San, has more finesse, but sometimes less power. Musically, the whole thing is in the capable hands of the young conductor Emmanuel Villaume, who made his company debut with this production in September. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. ANNE MIDGETTE 'TURANDOT' The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular it's critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calàf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liù. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $200. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo performances and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight brings a recital by Sergey Schepkin, a Russian-born pianist known for his refined yet dynamic Bach playing. Mr. Schepkin's program highlights his Bach specialty, with the composer's Italian Concerto and his French Overture (BWV 831), but it also reaches far beyond it, with various works by Debussy and Scriabin, including the latter's Ninth Sonata. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, the barge's artistic director and ubiquitous violinist Mark Peskanov is joined by Laura Usiskin (cello) and Katya Mihailova (piano) in works by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25. JEREMY EICHLER CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The Chamber Music Society takes a modest plunge into multimedia on Sunday afternoon. Determined to show that the second Viennese school isn't all that divorced from the first, the Brentano String Quartet will interleaf movements of Mozart with movements of Webern. The spoken word will make its appearance as well, with readings of poetry by Mark Strand -- art and culture in every direction. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48. BERNARD HOLLAND COMPOSER PORTRAIT: NICOLAI ROSLAVETS The Miller Theater's series of composer portraits usually spotlights the living or recently dead; but in this case the beam turns toward the first half of the 20th century, on the work of an early modernist who developed his own system of ''synthetic chords,'' embraced the ideals of the Bolshevik revolution and ultimately found himself -- like many of his colleagues -- proscribed by Stalin for the kinds of innovations that had been praised a decade or so earlier. Performing the composer's three surviving quartets is the Pacifica Quartet, worth hearing in its own right; other performers are Elizabeth Farnum, a soprano, and Margaret Kampmeier, a pianist, in works including his fifth piano sonata and selected songs. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20, $12 for students. MIDGETTE CUARTETO CASALS Young Spanish music is one theme at the Frick on Sunday: a Spanish quartet, formed in Madrid in 1997, will perform the second quartet by a Spanish composer, Juan Crisostomo Arriaga, who died when he was only 20. Arriaga's music has a wonderful light grace, and the Casals Quartet has recorded his three quartets for Harmonia Mundi. Another theme is the early 19th century: the program opens with Beethoven's ''Harp'' quartet from 1809 and closes with another quartet which, like Arriaga's, was written in 1824 by another composer who died young: Schubert's ''Rosamunde'' Quartet in A minor. Sunday afternoon at 5, Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-0700. Free, but tickets are required. MIDGETTE 'THE END OF THE MOON' Billed as a departure, Laurie Anderson's latest evening-length performance piece actually uses new technology to traverse familiar terrain. In a sing-song lilt that smooths off the rough edges of what she's saying, the artist talks about a wide range of topics, some of them touching on her recent stint as NASA's first-ever artist-in-residence. The grab-bag includes anecdotes, aphorisms (''Life is like bad art''), stretches of self-consciously poetic meditation and simple tunes on Ms. Anderson's electric viola, sampled into digital importance. Ms. Anderson celebrates the way that technology has shrunk, enabling her to fit all of her equipment into a couple of suitcases; unfortunately her content seems to have shrunk along with it. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 3, BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $50. MIDGETTE GUARNERI STRING QUARTET It seems to be raining Mendelssohn quartets these days, as new recordings have recently appeared by the Emerson, the Talich and the Leipzig String Quartets, with another on the way from the Pacifica Quartet. Adding to the spate of Mendelssohn, the Guarneri Quartet will perform the composer's youthful and enchanting Op. 12 this weekend in its series at the Metropolitan Museum. The program also includes Mozart's A major quartet (K. 464) and Dvorak's String Quintet (Op. 97), written during the idyllic summer this famously homesick composer spent among his countrymen in Spillville, Iowa. The Orion Quartet's violist, Steven Tenenbom, joins as a guest in the Dvorak. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $45. EICHLER 'THE HARTFORD COMMISSIONS' Two concerts this weekend celebrate the output in recent years by composers and musicians either living in or with professional connections to Hartford. The programs will introduce works by Dan Roman, Robert Carl James Sellars, Peter Alexander, Ken Steen, John McDonald and others. Violinist Katie Landsdale, bassist Robert Black and Mr. McDonald, a pianist as well as a composer, have organized the programs and will be among the performers. The concerts promise to present a group portrait of new music in Hartford. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. Tickets: $10. TOMMASINI LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS This ensemble never performs works that are more than 10 years old, which means that it must constantly refresh its repertory as old favorites fall out of bounds. Its program tonight includes ''Dig Deep,'' a string quartet by Julia Wolfe; the ''Trio Barbaro e Malinconico,'' for clarinet, violin and piano, by Paul Chihara; a set of études for piano by Julian Anderson; ''Crash,'' a string trio, by Stefan Weisman, and ''3,2,1'' by David Macdonald. Tonight at Riverside Church, 91 Claremont Avenue, at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, (718)458-4864. Free. ALLAN KOZINN MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO During the summer, young musicians convene at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont to study and perform with established soloists and chamber players, but the work doesn't end there. Throughout the season, ensembles representing the festival's best undertake tours, and since 1970 these groups have had an annual series at the Metropolitan Museum. Obviously, the chemistry will vary, but these groups usually do superb work, and tonight the Marlboro emissaries are offering an attractive program that includes Mozart's String Quintets in B flat (K. 174) and G minor (K. 516), as well as Hindemith's ''Melancholie,'' a vocal work with quartet accompaniment. The musicians are Frank Huang and Tai Murray, violinists; Eric Nowlin and Samuel Rhodes, violists, Efe Baltacigil, cellist, and Hyunah Yu, soprano. Tonight at 8, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $35. KOZINN * MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE The chamber concerts by the musicians of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra are programmatically adventurous and consistently well-played. On Sunday, the ensemble offers a program that mixes old and new. Schumann's Three Romances for Oboe and Piano (Op. 94) is offset by Gyorgy Kurtag's ''Hommage à R. Sch.'' for clarinet, viola and piano; Schubert's Quartettsatz in C minor (D. 703) is to precede John Harbison's ''November 19, 1828'' -- the title refers to the date of Schubert's death -- and the Berg Chamber Concerto for Piano, Violin and 13 Winds will be performed alongside Gyorgy Ligeti's Chamber Concerto for 13 Instruments. Sunday at 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $48 to $64. KOZINN NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Many musiclovers will be drawn to this weekend's New York Philharmonic concerts for the chance to hear Lorin Maazel conduct two enduringly popular works: Dukas's ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' The newsiest item on the program, though, is the Australian composer Ross Edwards's Oboe Concerto, in its American premiere. Mr. Maazel, who conducted its 2002 world premiere in Sydney, describes the work as a choreographic concerto. The soloist, the Australian oboist Diana Doherty, emerges from the wings in the dark, playing disembodied oboe lines. Gradually, as the lights go on, you see her prowl about the stage playing with various sub-groups of instruments. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90. TOMMASINI QI SHU FANG BEIJING OPERA COMPANY After a spate of activity in the wake of the Lincoln Center Festival's landmark production of ''The Peony Pavilion'' in 1999, Chinese opera has again become scarce in New York. This company of more than 50 singers, dancers, acrobats and instrumentalists, which I saw last in a fascinating mix of ancient and recent examples, returns with a staging of a classic, ''The Monkey King Wreaks Havoc in Heaven,'' and other works. With Qi Shu Fang sure to demonstrate her own acrobatic virtuosity, it promises to be an entertaining evening. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212)992-8484. Tickets: $30 and $35; $15 for students. JAMES R. OESTREICH UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WIND ENSEMBLE Concert bands are not something the classical music world pays much heed, but this one, directed by Jerry Junkin, grabbed attention last year with a wonderful CD from Reference Recordings, ''Bells for Stokowski.'' There was fun, with dances from Tylman Susato's collection ''Danserye'' of 1551 in wildly anachronistic arrangements. But there was also serious business, with premiere recordings of works by Michael Daugherty and David Del Tredici. The program here, conducted by Mr. Junkin and Robert Carnochan, offers the New York premiere of John Corigliano's ''Circus Maximus'' (Symphony No. 3) and works by Handel, Copland and Donald Grantham. This spirited group should bring it all vividly to life. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $40. OESTREICH Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. 'BUTTER MELTS AWAY MY LETTERS' Choreographed by Stephanie Rafferty and conceived and directed by Gian Marco Lo forte, this theater-dance piece visits a group of young runaways to New York City who cannot quite shrug off the past. Jack Anderson described it as ''oddly hypnotic'' in a recent review in The New York Times. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street west of Second Avenue, Manhattan, (212)475-7710. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted. JENNIFER DUNNING CONDORS An all-male Japanese troupe whose irrepressibly eccentric productions have been compared with Monty Python offers Ryohei Kondo's ''Mars: Conquest of the Galaxy II,'' a giddy fusion of slapstick comedy, dance and video. Tonight at 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)752-3015. Tickets: $30. JACK ANDERSON MICHAEL FLATLEY'S 'LORD OF THE DANCE' Love it or hate it, ''Shilelegh on the Roof,'' as it is irreverently known to some, is said to be the world's highest grossing dance show. Take that, Riverdance. Sadly, the superb Mr. Flatley is no longer performing, but this is still his show. Sunday at 7 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, L.I., (516) 299-3100. Tickets: $39, $51 and $65. DUNNING INNERLANDSCAPES DANCE THEATER This choreographic collective devoted to new works by a variety of choreographers presents dances by Nomi Bachar, Kathryn Sullivan, Natasa Trifan and Valerie Norman. Tonight at 9, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212)726-0660. Tickets: $20. ANDERSON ISRAEL CONTEMPORARY DANCE THEATER A company with a forceful style that was originally known as the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company offers the New York premiere of Irit Batzri's ''Screensaver,'' a hybrid of movement, stagecraft and video technology that explores humanity's public and private realms. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $34. ANDERSON RALPH LEMON In ''Come home Charley Patton,'' which concludes his ''Geography Trilogy,'' Mr. Lemon examines his own cultural heritage through the refracting prism of a 1920's lynching in Duluth, in his home state of Minnesota. In a review in The New York Times, Anna Kisselgoff wrote that the theater-dance piece is as much about memory as about a little-known lynching. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722. Tickets: $32. DUNNING NEW YORK CITY BALLET In this last weekend of the company's winter season, highlights include Jerome Robbins's luminous ''Glass Pieces'' (tonight and both performances tomorrow) and Christopher Wheeldon's ''Shambards'' (tomorrow afternoon). The programs also include George Balanchine's ''Symphony in Three Movements'' (tonight and tomorrow night); Robbins' ''Afternoon of a Faun'' (tonight); Peter Martins's ''Eros Piano'' (tonight); ''Chichesters Psalms'' (tomorrow night and Sunday); Balanchine's ''Apollo'' (tomorrow afternoon), and Robbins's ''Fanfare,'' Mr. Wheeldon's ''Liturgy'' and Balanchine's ''Stars and Stripes'' (Sunday). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570 or www.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30 to $83. DUNNING QI-SHU FANG PEKING OPERA COMPANY Presented by the World Music Institute, the troupe will perform ''The Flaming Phoenix'' (tonight); ''The Monkey King Wreaks Havoc in Heaven'' (tonight and tomorrow), and ''Fighting in the Dark'' and an excerpt from ''The Women Generals of the Yang Family'' (tomorrow). Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University, 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212)545-7536. Tickets: $30 and $35; $15 for students. DUNNING JUDITH SÁNCHEZ RUIZ Ms. Sanchez Ruiz has a rich performing history that includes gigs with Danza Abierta in her native Cuba, and Mal Pelo in Spain, Manhattan dance-downtowners including DD Dorvillier, and Henry Threadgill and other New York jazz musicians. Her latest ''Citizens or Individuals,'' set to music by Dafnis Prieto with set designs by Jonathan Cramer, examines the delicate balance between private and public self and the accommodations that must often be made to belong to a community. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted. Also at Danspace this weekend, Eleanor Dubinsky and Christine Suarez will present works in progress as part of the theater's free DraftWork series. Tomorrow at 3 p.m. DUNNING THREAD DANCE THEATER Amy Beth Schneider's all-female company explores partnership, both physical and metaphorical, here in her new ''Six-Story,'' a suite of dances set in a metaphorical female dwelling. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., University Settlement House, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (718)633-5678. Tickets: $15. DUNNING TRINITY IRISH DANCE COMPANY A Chicago-based group that both honors traditional Irish dance forms and uses them as the bases for modern abstractions and New Age conceptions joins forces with the musical ensemble Different Drums of Ireland. Sunday at 2 p.m., Lehman Concert Hall, Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard, the Bronx, (718)960-8833. Tickets: $15 and $25. ANDERSON * CATHY WEIS PROJECTS Ms. Weis's nutty imagination and humor combine, in her dance and video pieces, to create art that has been described as rough-edged magic. High technology is not her bag. Instead, her work has a wonderfully home-made look. Ms. Weis's new ''Electric Haiku: Calm as Custard'' is a more meditative and less raucous suite of short segments than its predecessor, the 2002 ''Electric Haiku.'' There are some dazzling video-dance images and belly-laugh humor, but the heart of ''Calm as Custard'' is a conversation of sorts with a vibrant and thoughtful artist. The cast also includes downtown performance and dance stars Scott Heron, Diane Madden and Jennifer Miller. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org . Tickets: $25. DUNNING 92 ON 42: ZVI DANCE Presented by the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center as part of its winter series at the Duke, the Israeli-born choreographer Zvi Gotheiner, known as a gifted teacher and the creator of darkish dances that explore the human heart, will present his new ''Territories,'' a dance-theater piece that addresses space and its division. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Tickets: $20. DUNNING Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums 'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white male artists, and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children 16 and under and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. ROBERTA SMITH 'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish. GRACE GLUECK 'FIRST SEEN: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES, 1840-1880,' Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212)759-0606, through May 1. Mothers nursing babies, vignettes of the Crimean War, high life under the British Raj, exploited child workers, holy men, Chinese women with bound feet, Kirghiz tribesmen, American Indians and on and on, not to mention a snappy picture of the novelist George Sand in her accustomed male drag, wielding a cigarette. These are some of the 250 photographs taken all over the world by early lensmen. The idea of the show, chosen from the vast archives of the Wilson Center for Photography in London, was to focus on ''first'' glimpses of people rather than the more usual views of landscapes, mountains or relics that were easier subjects for the ponderous pioneer camera to handle. The profusion of images may cause the viewer's mind to boggle, but it gives a good idea of the worldwide sweep of the early camera's lens. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $4 for 65+, students and educators. GLUECK * 'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7. HOLLAND COTTER 'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, Washington Heights, (212)926-2234, through March 5. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Doré, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free. COTTER Galleries: Uptown RICHARD HICKAM: 'BEYOND THE SURFACE,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through March 26. The faces in this group of quirky Expressionist portraits slip and slide into grotesque masks under the artist's loose brushstrokes, rich textures and bold manipulations of color. But they hint at universals, like ''The Teacher,'' a particularly haunting welter of features that includes a strained toothy smile under a beaky nose, an unkempt thatch of straight, straw-colored hair and a dark scraggle of beard. The dyspeptic-looking ''Night Reader,'' with a yellowish head the shape of an Idaho potato held at a slight angle, a twisted gash of mouth and a pair of glasses that sit crookedly on the suggestion of a nose, evokes an aged and bedeviled aesthete (as well as the Wizard of Oz). At their peak, his faces seem to bare the souls of their wearers. GLUECK ALEKSANDRA MIR: 'NEW DESIGNS,' Roth Gallery, East 70th Street, (212)717-9067, through March 5. The ever-resourceful Aleksandra Mir designs her own antiwar pro-abortion campaign with posters proclaiming ''Be Gentle in Fallujah'' and ''Keep Abortion Legal,'' as well as small, slogan-bearing goody-bag items including a Swiss Army knife, dental floss and a scarf. But she takes a more ambivalent viewpoint with a series of drinking glasses printed with the faces of newborns that are identified as the reincarnations of various recently deceased celebrities. Mass culture has long borrowed the strategies of Conceptual Art; it is always nice to see artists borrow back. SMITH JOHN WALKER: 'COLLAGE,' Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, through March 19. This English artist who now lives in Maine produced the six powerfully imposing Cubist collages featured here while living and teaching in New York in the mid-70's. Each measures 10 by 8 feet and has leathery surfaces of painted, irregularly cut-up pieces of canvas. Today they seem old fashioned, even a little academic. Still, the rumbling, viscerally physical energy they exude remains exciting. KEN JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street PAT ADAMS: 'PAINTINGS 1954 - 2004,' Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, (212)752-1223, through March 5. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of her first solo show at this gallery, Ms. Adams's exhibition of small paintings takes an abbreviated look back over her long and distinguished career. Works from the last four decades typically feature richly textured fields punctuated by sharply defined abstract elements that seem to cavort like Platonic archetypes through the space of a universal collective consciousness. JOHNSON 'FACE TO FACE: DAN MASKS FROM THE IVORY COAST AND AQUATINTS BY HENRI MATISSE,' Pace Primitive/Pace Master Prints, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3237, through March 19. This first collaboration between the Primitive and the Print departments of this wide-ranging gallery, this show brings together Matisse's ultrasimplified female faces in aquatints from the 1940's and the refined, stylized late 19th-century and early 20th-century face masks from the Dan people of the Ivory Coast. While it can't be said that Matisse's aquatints here were directly influenced by them, his spare faces, drawn with a hand so practiced it could conjure up an image with a few strokes, seem to owe something to the often subtle stylizations of African art. Of all African masks, those by the Dan, with their minimal but expressively carved features and smooth modulation of facial planes, seem to go particularly well with his less-is-more renderings. GLUECK LOREN MADSEN: 'GODS AND DEMONS: AN INSTALLATION,' McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)688-5951, through March 5. Mr. Madsen is a sculptor who has invented ingenious ways to combine formalist abstraction and socially motivated conceptualism. A biomorphic wooden sculpture, for example, is a kind of three-dimensional chart illustrating the statistical ages at which people are killed by handguns. The main installation, an oblique commentary on the global impact of organized religions, consists of strings of glass beads hung from the ceiling, with beads of different colors representing quantities of key religious words inventoried in a search of three million book titles. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo ELLSWORTH KELLY: 'SMALL PAINTINGS, 1955 - 63,' Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, (212) 966-5154, through April 23. This little gem of an exhibition presents seven small paintings from a formative period in the career of one of our most celebrated abstractionists. Mr. Kelly's subtly witty, formally acute play with simple shapes, the picture plane and primary colors gives these works a punchy vitality the decades have done little to diminish. JOHNSON Galleries: Chelsea SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks. JOHNSON Last Chance 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400, closing on Sunday. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 62+, $5. SMITH GUY BEN-NER: 'WILD BOY,' Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-3323, through tomorrow. Two short films by Israel's representative to the 2005 Venice Biennale charmingly spoof quasi-scientific documentary filmmaking. Made entirely at home, ""Wild Boy"" is about a feral child (played by the artist's young son) who is captured, cleaned-up and trained by a researcher played by Mr. Ben-Ner. Another film that follows the fortunes of a family of ostriches played by the artist and his family in ridiculous costumes has a perfect anthropomorphizing voice-over. JOHNSON CECILY BROWN, Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)741-1111, closing tomorrow. Because it was a blend of Abstract Expressionist style and pornographic imagery that first drew the limelight to Ms. Brown, sensational things are expected of her. She disappoints by being merely good, as she is in her new work. With their all-over fields of splintery and squiggly gestures in nicely coordinated colors, her paintings based on landscape motifs are visually engaging, but they want some more adventurous approaches to form and imagery. JOHNSON JOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, Chelsea (212)929-8180, closing tomorrow. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color. SMITH 'PAPER,' Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3335, closing tomorrow. Highlights of this lively exhibition of things made on or of paper by more than 20 artists include a huge woodblock print by Mel Kendrick; Magic Realist ball point drawings of odd wooden structures by Billy Malone; John Pilson's video sequence of different hands drawing pigs; and Juliana Ellman's funny small painting of inflatable furniture going over a waterfall. JOHNSON JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212)737-3550, closing today. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toylike bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings. JOHNSON AARON SPANGLER, Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7700, closing tomorrow. You don't see much wood carving in elite Chelsea galleries, which makes it exciting to discover Mr. Spangler's large, intricate reliefs carved from three-inch slabs of maple and painted black. The Brooklyn-based sculptor uses his extraordinary technique to elaborate profusely detailed, darkly comic visions of rural, post-apocalyptic ruin. Wrecked buildings, crashed cars and trucks and abandoned appliances litter densely forested landscapes, and a magical tension emerges between the raw wood and the epic illusionism. JOHNSON HENRY TAYLOR, Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, closing tomorrow. Combining aspects of outsider art, quasi-academic figuration and early Pop Art, with found objects and plenty of rough-edged collage thrown in for good measure, the work of this Los Angeles painter seems a bit old-fashioned and all-over the place. But the work has a concentrated focus -- a very personal view of black life in L.A. -- buttressed by an appealing density and a promising fearlessness. SMITH",4fd25df58eb7c8105d80c8de,14927

Broadway 'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clichés of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley). 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of the great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Anne Midgette). 'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Isherwood) 'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'EINSTEIN'S GIFT' Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood) *'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, we only use street locators for avenues.(212)279-4200. (Isherwood) 'MARION BRIDGE' The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson) 'THE MASTER BUILDER' A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton) 'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson) 'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman) 'SLUT' This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn) *'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Brantley). *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson) 'WAR IN PARAMUS' It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today, only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger). Off Off Broadway 'THE ASPHALT KISS' Everything in Nelson Rodgrigues's play is exaggerated, from the deliberately melodramatic situation to the repetitive language, enunciated with Mamet-like emphasis. The strange intensity of the play, with its consciously stilted dialogue and acting, may not be to everyone's taste. But this production is an intriguing sample of Rodrigues's highly original voice (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt) 'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710. (Jefferson) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' this speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Zinoman) 'LATE FRAGMENT' Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama, titled after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'THE MARILYN TAPES' This doting biographical musical sticks to the highlights of Marilyn Monroe's life with a concentration on romance. Even if Lenore Zann isn't exactly the spit and image of Monroe -- which the Bert Stern photographs in the lobby make clear -- fans of the star will find her mannerisms and, most impressively, her agile, breathy voice quite convincing (1:30). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing Sunday.(Zinoman) *'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network's encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday.(Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott) 'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools (used to indoctrinate future leaders) to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis) *BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott) *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel. (Scott) *'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis) 'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott) 'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis) 'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates) *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis) *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott) 'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott) *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis) * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis) * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis) 'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Stephen Holden) 'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott) 'LOGGERHEADS' (No rating, 95 minutes) There is so much that is tender and true in Tom Kirkman's sensitively acted film about adoption that the few times it pauses to flaunt its metaphorical conceit about loggerhead turtles, you just have to grit your teeth and wait for the twitches of literary pretension to subside. (Holden) 'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates) 'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden) *'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden) * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott) * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden) 'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis) 'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden) 'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis) * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott) 'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis) 'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis) * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott) 'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis) FILM SERIES AFTER WAR (Through Sunday) The Japan Society's commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, a series of works about wartime and its aftermath, concludes on Sunday. The final film is ''A Man's Face Is His Résumé,'' Tai Kato's 1966 film noir about a war-hero doctor working in gang-infested Korean slums. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)832-1155; $10.

(Gates) NARUSE: THE UNKNOWN JAPANESE MASTER (Through Nov. 17) Film Forum's four-week retrospective of the films of the Japanese director Mikio Naruse begins this weekend with ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' (1960), about a young widow working in a Ginza nightclub. Next week's features include two 1953 films: ''Wife,'' about a salaryman with a useless spouse, and ''Older Brother, Younger Sister,'' about a domineering rural man with a brawler son and a pregnant daughter. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Gates) NEW FRENCH CONNECTION (Through Oct. 30) BAMcinématek's fourth annual program of contemporary French films begins on Wednesday with Raymond Depardon's ''Profiles of Farmers: Daily Life'' (2005), a sequel to his 2001 documentary on the same subject. Thursday's feature is the New York premiere of Jérôme Bonnell's award-winning ''Olga's Chignon'' (2003), a romantic comedy about a shopgirl and a small-town teenage boy. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $10. (Gates) NO VISA REQUIRED: FILMS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST (Through Nov. 19) The TriBeCa Film Institute and ArteEast are collaborating on a five-program screening of six films, followed by discussions with the filmmakers. The event continues tomorrow with a double feature. Elia Suleiman's Israeli/Palestinian ''Chronicle of a Disappearance'' (1996) is a series of vignettes about daily life in Nazareth and Jerusalem and their environs. Fouad Elkoury's ''Happy Days in Palestine'' (1998) is a French documentary about pre-Israeli settlers. Cantor Film Center, New York University, 36 East Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)941-3890; $10. (Gates) SOME LIKE IT WILDER: THE COMPLETE BILLY WILDER (Through Nov. 13) The Museum of the Moving Image is sponsoring a 26-film retrospective of Wilder, the Austrian-born director-writer who gave the world ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''Double Indemnity.''

(Sinagra) TRACY CHAPMAN (Tonight) This singer-songwriter's angsty pop-folk song ''Fast Car,'' a kind of anti-''Born To Run,'' became an instant classic when late-1980's recession sank in, offering a working-class escape fantasy so modest that it was heartbreaking. 6:30, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882; $39. (Sinagra) BRUCE COCKBURN (Tomorrow) The smoky-voiced Canadian folk-rocker Bruce Cockburn is just as opinionated and oppositional as he was when he wrote the anti-imperial ''If I Had a Rocket Launcher,'' though recently he has been letting his guitar do the emoting. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212)307-7171 ;$30 to $35.(Sinagra) CREAM (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) All the members of the 60's British power trio behind ''White Room,'' and ''Badge'' are alive and well, but top dollar is required to see if Eric Clapton's slow hand has gotten slower, or the bassist Jack Bruce's bellow less blustery.

(Sinagra) FREAKWATER, JOHN PARISH (Thursday) Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean of Freakwater harmonize like a country duo from decades ago, calmly examining all the disappointments and morbid fantasies -- heartache, suicide, children's deaths -- of a hard life in the boondocks. Now and then, a proudly clever line signals that they're not as rural as they might sound. John Parish has been an essential collaborator for P.J. Harvey and the Eels, playing guitar and keyboard parts distilled to a stark simplicity. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12.

(Sinagra) JAMIROQUA (Monday and Tuesday) Taking its cues from Stevie Wonder, this British dance-pop band led by the madly hatted singer Jay Kay had a hit in the 90's with the blandly groovy ''Virtual Insanity,'' and gained more a jam-band than a dance-music following. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $40.

The group plays between the Ex-Models and Pterodactyl. 10- p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503; $8.

(Sinagra) THE RAPTURE (Tonight) This Brooklyn band tops its tight dance-punk grooves with the rhythmically yelping panic of the vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tone recalls the Cure's Robert Smith. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) THE ROGERS SISTERS, SCOUT NIBBLET (Wednesday) Though the Brooklyn power-trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, they take themselves less seriously than most.

Harvey. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.

(Sinagra) STEW (Monday) This Los Angeles pop craftsman writes songs that slip just enough bitters into the 70's lite rock cocktail to make it subversive. His faux-big production on disc isn't required live, because his songs are cabaret to the core.

(Sinagra) RICHARD THOMPSON, DANNY THOMPSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Mr. Thompson, one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads.

His guitarist son Danny joins him. 9 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $25. (Pareles) MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Tuesday) Like her parents, Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright, the folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright can be roundly sad or quippishly tart.

(Anne Midgette) 'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Thursday) Nicolas Joël's production of Donizetti's most popular opera seemed pointlessly opulent, murky, confusing and cluttered when it was first presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1998. The company has since cleared away some of the clutter, and the production returns with new stage direction from Zoe Pappas. The cast, which looks to be strong, includes Elizabeth Futral as the mentally fragile Lucia. Edoardo Müller, a bel canto specialist, conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini) 'TOSCA' (Tonight and Wednesday) Mark Lamos's 1998 production of this Puccini favorite has returned with its stark geometric elegance intact. Carla Thelen Hanson is making a fine, darkly shaded Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a bold, swaggering Scarpia. Tonight at 8, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The venerable Amato Opera may seat scarcely more than 100, but it can't be accused of cowardice. This weekend it begins a run of one of the hardest operas for soprano in the repertory, Verdi's ''Traviata.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30; students and 65+, $25. (Midgette) Classical Music BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This festival chooses a single composer each year and places him in a rich cultural context through concerts, lectures and panel discussions. This summer it was Copland, and the festival concludes with a final weekend beginning tonight, with Leon Botstein conducting the American Symphony Orchestra in a program titled ''From the Concert Stage to Hollywood.'' The program, repeated Sunday, includes ''Rodeo'' and the ''Lincoln Portrait,'' narrated by the filmmaker Ken Burns. Full schedule: www.bard.edu/bmf. Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900; $20 to $55. (Eichler) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Tonight, the guitarist Simon Wynberg joins the violinist Mark Peskanov in works by Bach, Paganini and Schubert. Tomorrow and Sunday, the barge opens its gangplank to an entire chamber orchestra, the Teatro Olimpico Orchestra of Vicenza, which arrives bearing Telemann, Corelli, Vivaldi and Dragonetti. And Thursday, it's back to small-scale chamber music with Cherubini, Debussy and Beethoven. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083; $35; chamber orchestra concerts, $50. (Eichler) BORODIN STRING QUARTET (Tonight) This group, founded in Moscow in 1945, still has one original member, the cellist Valentin Berlinsky. Its credentials in 20th-century Russian chamber music are unimpeachable, and include working directly with Shostakovich on the composer's own quartets. It will play No. 15 tonight, a breathtaking string of adagio movements, along with Beethoven's ''Serioso'' Quartet and ''Grosse Fuge.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $44 to $52. (Eichler) CONCERTANTE (Sunday) This omnivorous ensemble focuses on chamber repertory beyond the string quartet. Its program includes Beethoven's String Trio in C minor, Dvorak's String Sextet and ''Il Tramonto'' by Respighi. 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330; $20. (Eichler) EUROPA GALANTE (Sunday) The violinist Fabio Biondi, the director of this Italian period-instrument group, is a dynamo -- enough so that he can be counted on here to breathe new life even into Vivaldi's overworked ''Four Seasons,'' along with music by Telemann and Mozart. 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $56. (James R. Oestreich) JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) This feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and major works. The program this time includes works by Bach, J.C. Bach, Arriaga, Villa-Lobos and Ney Rosauro. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212)799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn) 'MASTERS OF MODERN AMERICAN ART SONG' (Thursday) Three singers -- Amy Synatzske, a soprano; Michael Polscer, a tenor; and Timothy A. Hill, a baritone -- perform songs and cycles by David Del Tredici, David Eddleman and Tom Cipullo on themes ranging from the comic (settings of Billy Collins's poetry) to the tragic (a piece about the murder of Matthew Shepard). 8 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $23. (Kozinn) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) Pieces by John Cage and Henry Cowell and also by Beethoven and Schumann mix and match as strings and piano come together in an evening of chamber music. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $30. (Holland) MUNICH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Founded in 1945 by Kurt Graunke, whose name it bore for many years, this orchestra has long supported itself recording scores for the German film industry while working on its more conventional concert career. This weekend, it appears under Philippe Entremont, who acts as soloist in Mozart's K. 467 piano concerto and conducts the Brahms Second Symphony. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $50. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) The Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto is the highlight of a program that also includes Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem and Bartok's Dance Suite, conducted by Gianandrea Noseda, with the pianist Simon Trpceski. Itzhak Perlman arrives to conduct and perform concerts on Wednesday and Thursday that are already sold out. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $26 to $94 tonight and tomorrow. (Midgette) ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) Everyone complains about the completion of Mozart's Requiem by his pupil Süssmayr, but few people have done much about it -- or at least as much as Robert Levin has done in his recent edition. Donald Runnicles conducts it with this orchestra and the excellent Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chamber Chorus. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $21 to $74. (Oestreich) ROYAL STOCKHOLM PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Swedish orchestra, not a frequent visitor, will be ushered into Carnegie Hall by the American conductor Alan Gilbert. Scandinavian music and musicians abound in two programs, with soloists like the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and the pianist Lars Vogt, along with a raft of homegrown composers. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $26 to $90. (Holland) 'SACRED BRIDGES: THE PSALMS OF DAVID IN ORIENT AND OCCIDENT' (Sunday) The Turkish ensemble Sarband has engaged in fascinating cross-cultural exchanges with the German early-music band Concerto Köln. In this concert and in a new recording from World Village, it pursues similar explorations with the seemingly squarely Western King's Singers. 4 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212)721-6500; $48. (Oestreich) SERGEY SCHEPKIN (Tomorrow) Well known as a Bach specialist, this pianist begins the Metropolitan Museum's season-long series Piano Forte, which juxtaposes composers with more or less in common: Beethoven and Schubert, Chopin and Rachmaninoff, and -- with Mr. Schepkin and others -- Bach and Brahms. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949; $40 (Oestreich) ANTOINE TAMESTIT (Tonight) This young French violist performs as part of Carnegie Hall's Distinctive Debuts series. Besides having impressive credentials, Mr. Tamestit offers an enticing program, with works by Schubert, Schumann, Shostakovich, Zimmermann and Britten. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $26. (Tommasini) TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The 92nd Street Y's quartet in residence is a quirky, uneven, yet undeniably accomplished ensemble. To begin its season, it is joined by Phillip Ying, the violist of the Ying Quartet, and Carol Wincenc, a flutist, for an all-Mozart program. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500; $40. (Midgette) ZURICH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Sharon Isbin joins this elite group from Switzerland in a Bach concerto arranged for guitar and strings. Conducted by Howard Griffiths, who took over the orchestra in 1996, the concert also includes Schubert, Vivaldi, Dvorak's serenade for strings, and the New York premiere of Fabian Müller's ''Labyrinth.'' 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500; $35. (Midgette) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. *AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Through Nov. 6) The company's three-week City Center season continues, with a particularly attractive program tonight consisting of Balanchine's ''Apollo,'' Mark Morris's ''Gong'' and the company premiere of Kurt Jooss's ''Green Table.'' Tomorrow's matinee offers the first regular-season performance of Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo,'' introduced at the opening-night gala. The Wednesday program has ''Kaleidoscope,'' a new ballet by Peter Quanz first seen yesterday, along with company revivals of Anthony Tudor's ''Dark Elegies'' and Twyla Tharp's ''In the Upper Room.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 7:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212 or www.abt.org or www.nycitycenter.org; $25 to $90. (John Rockwell) BROOKLYN BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) This small company opens its season with a premiere by the artistic director Lynn Parkerson. ''Mystery Sonatas'' takes its name from the title of a score by the 17th-century composer Heinrich Biber, and the company's news release promises a stage inhabited by angels, madonnas, sinners and saints. The violinist Gil Morgenstern will perform the Biber sonatas. The program also includes a work-in-progress by Ms. Parkerson, using street performers as well as her own classically trained dancers. Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn Campus, Long Island University, 75 DeKalb Street, at Flatbush Avenue, downtown Brooklyn, (718)246-0146; $25 to $40; students, $15. (Roslyn Sulcas) CLARE BYRNE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) ''Sweet Chariots'' is a cycle of five soulful dances expressing thanksgiving, vulnerability and surrender. 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479; $15. (Jack Anderson) CREATIVE TIME (Today through Sunday) The choreographer William Forsythe is one of 14 (mostly visual) artists participating in an exhibition, ''The Plain of Heaven,'' inspired by the proposed redevelopment of the High Line, the defunct elevated railway on the West Side of Manhattan. Brock Labrenz, a former Frankfurt Ballet dancer, will perform amid 34 pendulums in Mr. Forsythe's exploration of the experience of time, motion and memory. Noon to 6 p.m. (then every Friday through Sunday until Nov. 20), 820 Washington Street, at Gansevoort Street, in the meatpacking district, www.creativetime.org; free. (Sulcas) 'THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT' (Monday). Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Career Transitions for Dancers, the nonprofit organization dedicated to easing aging dancers into the rest of their lives, this gala will feature Liza Minnelli as host and offer a range of performers not seen since Fall for Dance. 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $45 to $125. (Rockwell) SAVION GLOVER (Tomorrow) In ''Classical Savion,'' this tap dance virtuoso continues his admirable expansion of his field by finding unexpected rhythmic correspondences in music by Bach, Bartok, Mendelssohn, Piazzola and Vivaldi. 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, Brooksville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100 or www.tillescenter.org; $40 to $65; ages 65+, $37 to $62. (Sulcas) *Grupo Corpo (Through Oct. 29). One of the foremost Brazilian modern-dance troupes, with choreography by Rodrigo Pederneiras. Tuesday at 7 p.m. and Thursday through Oct. 29 at 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $60. (Rockwell) SCOTT HERON & JODI MELNICK (Wednesday through Oct. 29) Two veteran artists on an appealing double bill. The always imaginative Ms. Melnick presents events that ''may or may not have happened'' in ''Wanderlust, Kentucky,'' and Mr. Heron performs the irresistibly titled ''Flossing''-- in which he will apparently assume the dual personas of a box of dental floss and the tooth fairy. Also on the program are ''3X Donovan'' and a premiere, ''Gumdrops and Cupcakes.'' 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students, ages 65+ and artists, $12. (Sulcas) ICE THEATER OF NEW YORK (Tonight) ''Dance Visions on Ice'' includes pieces by the ice-dance choreographers David Liu and Douglas Webster, with the guest performers Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostomarov, World Ice Dance Champions, and Yukina Ota, 2003 Junior World Champion. 7, Sky Rink, Chelsea Piers, Pier 61, 23rd Street and the Hudson River, (212)929-5811 or www.icetheatre.org; $20; students, children, groups of 10 or more and ages 65+, $15. (Jennifer Dunning) LEESAAR COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Military movement inspires the choreographic vocabulary of ''Herd of Bulls.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101 or www.ps122.org; $20. (Anderson) PAVEL LISKA'S 'POETICS' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Liska describes this new piece as ''a ballet brut.'' 8, Theater of the Riverside Church, 91 Claremont Avenue, between 120th and 122nd Streets, Morningside Heights, (212)870-6784 or www.ColumbiaStages.com; $10; students and 65+, $5. (Dunning) LIT (Tomorrow) Otherwise known as ''Loft Into Theater,'' this showcase celebrates the work of eight choreographers from leading modern-dance groups and the funky yet pristine setting in which their pieces will be performed. 8 p.m., Hundred Grand, 100 Grand Street, at Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)926-6573; $15; students and 65+, $12. (Dunning) LUIS LARA MALVACÍAS (Tonight through Sunday night) ''Badman,'' for an all-male cast, creates an environment in which social codes regulating definitions of masculinity break down. 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194; $15. (Anderson) NEW YORK BUTOH FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) The performers appearing in the closing days of this ambitious festival are Kan Katsura in his new ''Time Machine,'' and Azumaru performing to music by Jack Wright (both tonight at 7), and Masaki Iwana in his new ''Beast of Grass'' (tonight at 9:30). Appearing tomorrow and Sunday are Mr. Iwana and cokaseki in the new ''Tooboe'' (tomorrow at 5 p.m.); Akira Kasai in his new ''Flowers'' and Evan Mazunik and the New York Soundpainting Orchestra (tomorrow at 8 p.m.) and Mr. Kasai and Mr. Katsura (Sunday at 2:30 p.m.) Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue between Ninth and 10th Streets, East Village, (212)561-9539 or www.caveartspace.org; $20; students, $17. (Dunning) THE PARSONS DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday) David Parsons and his full-throttle dancers present his new ''DMB,'' to music by the Dave Matthews Band, and repertory including ''Wolfgang,'' a tribute to Mozart; and ''Shining Star,'' to music by Earth, Wind and Fire. Tonight and Tuesday through Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $40. (Dunning) THE STORY OF TAP (THE SEQUEL) (Tonight and tomorrow night) Hank Smith is host of weekend programs in which some of the leading tap dancers in New York converse and dance. 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, SoHo, (212)219-0736, Ext. 110, or www.dixonplace.org; $10 to 15; advance tickets $12 at theatermania.com. (Anderson) ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dance joins forces with words, singing and narrative in ''Michael,'' an erotically charged dance set inside a 42-foot-long trailer decorated with Victorian floral wallpaper and prim furniture. The choreographer says her production is for mature audiences only. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students and 60+, $12. (Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck) *THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith) *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck). *JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212)423-3200. (Glueck) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson) MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck) QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson) *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck) Galleries: Uptown 'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8300, through May 6. (Johnson) 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street 'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson) YINKA SHONIBARE: 'MOBILITY' This British sculptor presents two spare installations using his signature post-colonialist symbol: the headless mannequin in 19th-century European clothes cut from African fabrics. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Oct. 29. (Johnson) Sue Williams Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter) Other Galleries *André KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson) 'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson) LineAge: 'Selections Fall 2005' Among works by nine emerging artists in this entertaining show are poetic, notarized documents by CarianaCarianne, who claims to be two people in one body; intricately cutout linear abstractions by Adam Fowler; big drawings of human navels by Susan D'Amato; and a sculpture by Monika Grzymala, made by wrapping 4.4 miles of paper tape around three columns in the gallery. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166, through Oct. 29. (Johnson) *MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5154, through Oct. 29. (Smith) *'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck) *Evan Penny: 'No-One In Particular' This Toronto-based sculptor creates astoundingly realistic and, in some cases, weirdly distorted bigger-than-life busts of people out of silicone, rubber, hair and other materials. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)999-7337, through Oct. 29. (Johnson) Last Chance *Robert Bordo A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing tomorrow. (Cotter) *Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) Claire Fontaine Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, closing today. (Johnson) * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON' Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500, closing on Sunday. (Cotter) 'Tracking Suburbia' AND 'Do You Like Stuff?' From Jean-Frédéric Schnyder's more-than-30-foot-long photograph of every building on the road between two Swiss towns in ''Tracking Suburbia'' to Frank Olive's countertop display of 100 items you could buy cheaply in a drugstore in ''Do You Like Stuff?,'' these two smart and wry group shows invite meditation on modern materialism. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, SoHo, (212)925-2035, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show says. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing on Sunday. (Michael Kimmelman) NEIL WELLIVER: 'A MEMORIAL EXHIBITION,' Five large paintings from the late 1970's and early 80's make an exhilarating tribute to this esteemed painter of Maine landscapes, who died last April at 75. Measuring up to 8 by 10 feet, the canvases depict dense woods, a rocky summit and marshland with beaver dams, and they are painted with generous, wide-brush strokes and a keen eye for natural light and texture. They are at once vividly realistic, expressively abstract and sensuously physical. Alexandre, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)",4fd2872e8eb7c8105d85874b,14555

Broadway + 'ALL SHOOK UP' Compared to its sickly cousin, ''Good Vibrations'' (that's the Beach Boys musical), this synthetic jukebox musical, inspired by the songs of Elvis Presley, looks like Jose Canseco at his steroid-plumped peak. But the relative slickness of ''All Shook Up,'' which features the appealing Cheyenne Jackson as an Elvis-like roustabout, only highlights the emptiness of this ''Mamma Mia!''-style story of a pleasure-challenged small town, directed by Christopher Ashley. In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $19.55 to $100. BEN BRANTLEY 'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are on a rampage in Daniel Sullivan's carnage-happy interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy. Dripping blood and breathing smoke, these specters are chewing up everything in their path: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus. As the most important passenger on this fast, bumpy ride of a show, Mr. Washington does not embarrass himself. But despite several moving evocations of Brutus's ambivalence, he can't help getting lost amid the wandering, mismatched crowd assembled here. The cast includes the classically polished Colm Feore as Cassius (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51.25 to $101.25. BRANTLEY * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $90.25. BRANTLEY +'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' Memory, which is notorious for playing tricks on people, pulls off some doozies in this narcoticized production of Tennessee Williams's classic drama. Staged by David Leveaux, this revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea through which people swim slowly and blindly. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange, who brings a sleepy, neurotic sensuality to the role of the vital and domineering Amanda Wingfield, and Christian Slater, who is a red-hot firebrand as her poetical son, Tom (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25. BRANTLEY +'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason and ''Spamalot'' make an odd Broadway pair facing off across 44th Street, but reactions to the two shows are remarkably similar: lots of laughter, much of it indiscriminate. Mr. Mason's new show is being promoted as a feast of exclusively new material, and this is not false advertising. But it's Mr. Mason's style and not his subject matter that signifies. Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $81. 25. CHARLES ISHERWOOD 'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people (including the cast) that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience among school-age children and grown-ups in touch with the nerdy, nose-thumbing 12-year-olds within. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a cast that includes Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria and the toothsome scenery chewer Sara Ramirez (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25. BRANTLEY +'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' In Robert Harling's freeze-dried comedy, people speak in the kinds of sentences that wind up embroidered on decorative pillows: ''There is no such thing as natural beauty,'' or, ''I'd rather have 30 minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.'' Cute and sassy or sweet and soggy, the dialogue sometimes achieves the distinction of being all these things. But despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television (including Christine Ebersole, Delta Burke and Marsha Mason), sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.75 to $86.25. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'CALIGULA.' Playing the famously vainglorious Roman ruler Caligula reinvented as a postmodern actor-cum-director, gasbag moralist and irreverent critic of biographies about himself, Andre De Shields is phenomenal. This particularly gifted and disciplined actor blasts Alfred Preisser and Randy Weiner's play onto an electrified plane where histrionic egomania and sweaty petulance seem like the only ways to fill a stage. A Classical Theater of Harlem production directed by Mr. Preisser, this Caligula is an original work, not an adaptation of Camus, and like the company's 2003 hit production of Genet's ''Blacks,'' the show makes resonant use of a generalized, shabby circus setting and interactions with the audience that deliberately risk offense. Consistency of ideas isn't the show's strength, but the diminutive Mr. De Shields makes it all worthwhile, towering over the 13 other actors with his outsized energy and charisma (1:25). Classical Theater of Harlem at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, between 141st and 142nd Streets, (212)868-4444. Tickets: $25. JONATHAN KALB 'DECO DIVA' Kara Wilson makes her entrance in an emerald green evening dress. She is the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka, living in Paris in 1939. In the course of the play, Ms. Wilson paints a copy of Lempicka's ''Beautiful Rafaela,'' which feels like a parlor trick but adds needed texture to this stylish but lightweight work. After her daughter was born, Lempicka took up painting, in the new Art Deco style, finding both career satisfaction and financial success. Ms. Wilson, who is likably insouciant as Lempicka, occasionally breaks into song. The show ends with a little Kurt Weill, which seems appropriate (1:05) 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8:30 p.m.; Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 p.m. Tickets: $25. ANITA GATES +'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat and shiny leather boots, her hair styled in a sleek blond cap, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in the Classic Stage Company's revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but Mr. Kulick's efficient but mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air. Its stark simplicity underscores the sensation that we might almost be watching a Shakespeare comedy unfolding in a cold-storage warehouse (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; this Sunday and May 1 at 3 p.m. Tickets: 45 to $50. ISHERWOOD ++'GOING TO ST. IVES' Questions of life and death are probed and settled over pots of tea in Lee Blessing's thoughtful, tidy two-hander. May N'Kame (L. Scott Caldwell), the mother of a bloodthirsty African dictator, and Dr. Cora Gage (Vivienne Benesch), a respected British eye surgeon, are brought together by circumstance: May's eyesight is failing. Their relationship will have fateful consequences for both. Mr. Blessing has a handy knack for domesticating seemingly unruly subject matter: the violent legacy of colonialism, the responsibility of Western governments to confront the carnage in Africa, the moral argument for sacrificing one life to save many. But if the play's structural and thematic niceties are intellectually pleasing, they also imbue it with a hollow, manufactured quality that fine performances cannot entirely disguise (2:00). Primary Stages, 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD +'BONNIE PARKER' In the middle of her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick suddenly does a cartwheel. And at one point she inexplicably gets down on the floor and poses like the young woman in Andrew Wyeth's ''Christina's World.'' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow in Depression-era America and died with him at 23), but Ms. Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character, a young Texas woman who is bored before she meets Barrow and dissatisfied afterward, and the exposition is consistently awkward, This is not to say that Ms. Sedgwick does not have ability or promise, only that this is an immature work (2:00). John Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444. Mondays, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 3:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.95. GATES 'THIS IS HOW IT GOES' Ben Stiller, famous in movies as an everyklutz, is the ideal guide for escorting audiences through the slippery maze of Neil LaBute's extended ploy of a play, directed by George C. Wolfe. In this story of an interracial romantic triangle, Mr. Stiller gives an artfully layered, deceptive performance that leaves you thinking it's a pity he had to portray a moral construct instead of a character. The same might be said of Jeffrey Wright as his surly rival. Fortunately, the wonderful Amanda Peet, exuding an aura of fractured confidence, is allowed to exist outside of the confining dimensions of a sermon (1:30). Public Theater/Anspacher Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60. BRANTLEY 'WHAT OF THE NIGHT' A solo show starring Jane Alexander as Djuna Barnes, the literary adventurer best known for her spooky modernist novel ''Nightwood,'' this theatrical curio combines some of the standard facets of dead-celebrity stage plays with the more rarefied and often inscrutable behaviors endemic in the world of performance art. Conceived by Ms. Alexander, choreographer and director Birgitta Trommler and Noreen Tomassi, it provides a sense of Barnes' strange, hallucinatory prose, but remains a confusing amalgam of biography and literary homage: a morass of cranky chitchat, pointless stage business and arcane oration (1:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD Off Off Broadway 'THE AUDIENCE' This new musical turns the footlights on Rows A through E at a fictional Broadway production. Conceived and directed by Jack Cummings III, the show has been assembled from contributions by a few dozen writers, composers and lyricists. Whiplash-inducing fluctuations in quality and style are not a problem, however: while there are moments both sentimental and funny here, most of the contributors seem to have obeyed an official mandate to stick strictly to stereotype (1:40). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $19. ISHERWOOD 'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language, ''Finnegans Wake,'' sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce. If some of the tedium of the original comes through, so does the music of its language; and if the performance is uneven, it offers moments of beauty and insight, as when all the characters come under a veil that suddenly recasts itself as the sheet of Finnegan's bed as he, dreaming through an epic that seeks to explore human consciousness at night, begins to wake up (2:30). The Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sunday nights at 7. Tickets: $15. ANNE MIDGETTE 'PLAY IN A PUB' It can be thrilling when one performance in an earthbound double bill about love and desire abruptly takes off, pulling the enterprise into the realm of feeling and belief. As a wry young Frenchwoman who chooses an ex-G.I. as her first lover, Kelli Holsopple persuades you that you are not in a restaurant bar in the East Village watching Romulus Linney's one-act play ''Can Can,'' but in France, with her. The evening opens with ''A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot,'' a revealing burlesque by Tennessee Williams about two lonely women of a certain age and their hunger for at least an encounter with the opposite sex, if not happiness. Phoenix Theater Ensemble's ''Play in a Pub'' runs through April 28 at the Bacchus Room, Bona Fides Restaurant, 60 Second Avenue, at Third Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15 plus one drink minimum. ANDREA STEVENS Last Chance +* 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. The well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble is led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas. You're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95. BRANTLEY +'HIDING BEHIND COMETS' The dynamics of the guy-walks-into-a-bar play are tricky. Inject a set of twins into the mix, as Brian Dykstra does in his play, and you've pretty much doomed the venture. The twins here are a male-female pair, 20-somethings named Troy (Robert Mollohan) and Honey (Moira MacDonald). They mind their father's dingy bar. The stranger who intrudes is Cole (Dan Moran), an elliptical older fellow with a temper. After much verbal sparring, and a lot of sex talk that isn't very sexy, the point emerges: Cole was supposedly at Jonestown during the mass suicide there in 1978, and he has dropped by the bar to force Honey and Troy to rethink their parentage. Mr. Dykstra's script sounds as if it's banking on the shock value of Jonestown, hoping that the audience, like the idiot twins on the stage, will not have heard of it. Way too early for that (1:45). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 3. Tickets: $35; $40 for Fridays and Saturday evenings. Closes April 17. NEIL GENZLINGER 'RADIUM' Alex S. DeFazio's unfocused drama operates on the ''now that I have your attention ...'' principle. The first scene is of two naked men simulating anal sex. One is the play's would-be hero, Alexis (as in Alex S., one presumes). The other, J., is the play's most interesting creation, a devastatingly good-looking guy whose favorite game is picking up men and then refusing to satisfy them sexually. ''I've never been rejected, not as I am,'' he says. Unfortunately, ''Radium'' isn't about J. The play does have an inventive Pinteresque structure, but basically Mr. DeFazio has written two acts of college-boy poetry about being gay, looking for emotional connections and feeling uncomfortable about it all (1:40). The Jewel Box Theater, at the 42nd Street Workshop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25, $15 for 65+ and students. GATES Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'BEAUTY SHOP' Directed by Billie Woodruff. Starring Queen Latifah, Alicia Silverstone, Kevin Bacon and Djimon Hounsou (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. Queen Latifa plays Gina, who quits her job at an upscale salon (run by Mr. Bacon's character) and opens her own establishment. Staffed by a group of boisterous women, along with a token male, the place soon becomes a neighborhood institution. Various subplots pop up now and then, but like its predecessors, this movie runs less on story than on the relaxed, playful humor that accompanies serious hair care. A.O. SCOTT 'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' Written and directed by Rebecca Miller. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis (R, 112 minutes). The Jack of all trades in this new film, played by the brilliant actor Daniel Day-Lewis, is no ordinary man. A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack lives alone on an island with his only daughter, Rose (Camilla Belle). Shrunk to near-skeletal size, his bones poking right angles through his clothes, Jack suffers from two heart conditions. One will soon put him six feet under. But before that, the other may send the terminal outsider and his daughter down the path of disaster, though one shaped more by the tao of Oprah and Dr. Phil than the tragedy of Lear and Cordelia. A story about the limits of love, ''The Ballad of Jack and Rose'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director. MANOHLA DARGIS 'GUESS WHO' Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Starring Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldaña (PG-13, 103 minutes). This loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' at least suggests that American racial attitudes have relaxed since 1967, when Spencer Tracy worried about Sidney Poitier marrying his daughter. This time, the worried father is played by Mr. Mac, and the suitor by Mr. Kutcher. Mr. Mac plays Percy Jones, a truculent suburban patriarch deeply suspicious of Simon Green, the amiable, spazzy stockbroker played by Mr. Kutcher. He and Ms. Saldaña, who plays Percy's older daughter and Simon's fiancée, is charming and attractive, but her role is quite secondary to what is at bottom an interracial buddy comedy. Or would be, if the squad of screenwriters had bothered to write any funny jokes. SCOTT * 'FEVER PITCH' Directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly. Starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch ''Fever Pitch,'' the new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. That is, of course, not big news. If Hollywood has taught us anything over the last century it is that every so often a seemingly ordinary commercial enterprise can afford us fleeting access to the sublime. And for my money, there are few movie moments right now more sublime than the image of Drew Barrymore running across a major league baseball field and, with that famous jaw jutting into the wind, dodging ballplayers and storybook clichés to save the windup of this imperfectly true romance. Based on the memoir by Nick Hornby, the film doesn't fully work, but I ended up rooting for it anyway, partly because Ms. Barrymore and her costar Jimmy Fallon make a nice fit, partly because the Farrellys bring so much heart to their movie. DARGIS 'HOSTAGE' Directed by Florent Siri. Starring Bruce Willis and Kevin Pollak (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Mr. Willis's fading career as an action hero. The star plays a former hostage negotiator who has exiled himself to a quiet southern California town after a botched standoff. He springs back into action when the cliff-hugging mansion of a crooked book-cooking corporate accountant (Mr. Pollak) is simultaneously invaded by a posse of teenage punks and by a S.W.A.T. team of high-tech gangsters. The fiery demolition of this architectural monstrosity in which the accountant lives with his two children is the only thing worth applauding in this mess of film. STEPHEN HOLDEN 'KUNG FU HUSTLE' Directed by Stephen Chow. Starring Mr. Chow (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese, with English subtitles). Recent Chinese-language action epics like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' ane ''Hero'' have been somber, almost operatic, so it is nice that the prolific Mr. Chow has supplied the latest reminder that the martial arts tradition has plenty of room for clowning. This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender -- western, Looney Tunes, and several generations of Hong Kong chopsockery. Some old stars have been coaxed out of retirment, most notably Yuan Qiu, who plays a chain-smoking, leather-lunged Landlady -- imagine a combination of Lucille Ball, Thelma Ritter and the Tasmanian Devil -- and who upstages even the most extravagant computer-generated special effects. There is sure to be a sequel, but it's hardly necessary, since the concussive action sequences induce a kind of amnesia. You could watch this movie again and again, which is another way of saying that, in the end, it isn't very memorable. SCOTT * 'LOOK AT ME' Directed by Agnès Jaoui. Starring Marilou Berry, Ms. Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). Ms. Jaoui follows her marvelous first feature, ''The Taste of Others,'' with an equally delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers (some of whom also have beautiful houses in the country), the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. Mr. Bacri plays a famous novelist whose cavalier neglect of his slightly overweight daughter (Ms. Berry) is the moral pivot on which the complex plot turns. Ms. Jaoui plays the young woman's voice teacher, who husband is an up-and-coming novelist and who is either the film's most honest character or its most thorough-going hypocrite. SCOTT 'MELINDA AND MELINDA' Directed by Woody Allen. Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Will Ferrell, Radha Mitchell and Chloe Sevigny (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though the drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, Mr. Allen interweaves them deftly enough and provides some of the members of his large cast with opportunities to do some crisp, old-fashioned stage-style acting. The link between the two tales in Ms. Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both -- an unhappy woman who throws the romantic, professional and social lives of a group of articulate Manhattanites into mild turmoil. In the tragedy, she chain-smokes and fidgets, while in the comedy she has an ingénue's golden glow. Some of the actors fare better than others -- Ms. Sevigny and Mr. Ejiofor seem best suited for Mr. Allen's anti-naturalistic approach to acting, while Mr. Ferrell's shambling geniality make him a poor choice for the inevitable role of Woody Allen surrogate. In any case, the movie is most powerful as an extended piece of real estate pornography, depicting a seductive fantasy New York (though filmed in the real one) where struggling filmmakers and out-of-work actors live in fabulous lofts and labyrinthine prewar apartments. SCOTT * 'MILLIONS' Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Alex Etel (PG, 97 minutes). When it comes to making movies, Mr. Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for ''Trainspotting,'' a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, and for the shiver-filled zombie flick ''28 Days Later,'' Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves his stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational debut), ''Millions'' is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination -- not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought -- takes boundless flight. DARGIS 'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' Directed by John Pasquin. Starring Sandra Bullock (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Ms. Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. Set a mere three weeks after the first film, which was released in 2000, this sequel finds Ms. Bullock as the charmingly clumsy F.B.I. agent Gracie Hart, vainly fending off unwanted celebrity. On her last assignment, Gracie infiltrated a beauty pageant by metamorphosing from duckling to swan, a mission that earned her legions of fans across the country. After her cover is blown during a bank heist, endangering her and the other agents on her team, the powers that be decide that she should become ''the face of the F.B.I.,'' the idea being that flouncing about in designer threads will be better for Gracie's soul and career and, by extension, this movie than pushing pencils. It isn't. DARGIS 'THE PACIFIER' Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Vin Diesel (PG, 97 minutes). In the primary visual gag of ''The Pacifier,'' a Navy Seal, on a top-secret babysitting mission, retrofits his gun and grenade holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. Despite the specter of boogeymen, Disney's new family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. As a special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Mr. Diesel succeeds as a genre-switcher through the help of an able ensemble. The mayhem should delight kids, just as the imposed order will please parents. Anyone else, however, might feel as though they are, in Mr. Diesel's words, merely ''burning daylight.'' NED MARTEL 'THE RING TWO' Directed by Hideo Nakata. Starring Naomi Watts (PG-13, 111 minutes). It was only a matter of time before the Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata went Hollywood and so he has at last as the director of, yes, ''The Ring Two,'' the inevitable sequel to the American remake of his original hit. (Got that?) Once again, Ms. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a journalist and a single mom to a young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), recently relocated from Seattle to a small coastal town in Oregon. In ''The Ring,'' Rachel escaped the marauding ghost in the machine and now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements, including some static with a potential boyfriend replacement (Simon Baker) and some weirdness with an asylum inmate (Sissy Spacek in a fright wig). Once again, blood pools, water flows and the ghost comes calling through the magic of video, scaring to death anyone foolish enough not to have made the move to DVD. DARGIS 'ROBOTS' Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha. With the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and Robin Williams (PG, 89 minutes). Like so many other non-Pixar computer-animated family movies, this one, from Fox's Blue Sky Studios, runs on visual novelty and narrative familiarity. The setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination, as are the characters, an assortment of dented heroes and sleek, silvery villains. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions, cool soundtrack music and heartwarming lessons about being yourself and following your dreams. There is, it must be said, a certain honesty to the story, which suggests that recycled, second-hand junk is superior to the latest high-tech upgrades, a moral the movie at once upholds and refutes. SCOTT 'SAHARA' Directed by Breck Eisner. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, Lambert Wilson, Glynn Turman, Delroy Lindo, William H. Macy and Rainn Wilson. (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but ''Sahara,'' the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. A fusion of old and new, it both is and isn't a delirious escape into adventure-serial heaven. Amid its madcap derring-do, the movie inserts clear, simple alarms about environmental protection, African despotism, global interdependence, and bureaucratic cowardice. Its dressing up of an old-fashioned adventure fantasy in contemporary threads is an experiment in juxtaposition that gains in assurance as the film bounds along. As the swashbuckling comic hero Dirk Pitt, Mr. McConaughey at last gets a clear shot at stepping into Harrison Ford's $20 million trekking shoes, but those shoes may not fit. HOLDEN * 'SCHIZO' Directed by Guka Omarova. Starring Olzhas Nusuppaev. (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian, with English subtitles). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender, and it illuminates the lives of its characters with bracing clarity and understated empathy. Schizo is a teen-aged boy living with his mother and her boyfriend in a desolate area of vast fields and ababandoned industry. After helping his would-be stepfather recruit fighters for illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches, Schizo gets involved with Zinka, a local woman whose husband has died in the ring after a brutal bout. Their friendship is sweet and a little improbable, but as the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story it achieves a rough, convincing poetry made of the hard circumstances of real life. SCOTT 'SIN CITY' Directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Starring Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis (R, 126 minutes). There are eight million stories in the naked city and almost as many crammed into ''Sin City.'' Based on the comic book series of the same name by Mr. Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls recycled from the lower depths and bottom shelves of pulp fiction. Instead of Raymond Chandler, though, these hard-boiled tales owe a debt to the American primitivism of Mickey Spillane and comic book legends like William Gaines. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. In recent years, Mr. Rodriguez has been a careless craftsman, but he went to great lengths to honor Mr. Miller's vision. Alas, in an effort to make a faithful adaptation, Mr. Rodriguez put his own movie sense on hold, not even bothering with a real script. DARGIS 'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' Directed by Mike Binder. Starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen to do some marvelous work. Both performances are somewhat familiar: Mr. Costner, once again, is an athlete past his prime, and Ms. Allen is a brittle, unhappy suburban housewife, but the actors slip into their characters with ease and wit, and complement each other beautifully as they explore a haphazard friendship that turns into a love affair. The downside is that Mr. Binder does not give them enough of a dramatic context to work in, and undermines their efforts with a surprise ending that very nearly destroys the whole movie. Ms. Witt, Ms. Christensen, Ms. Wood and Ms. Russell play Ms. Allen's daughters, but their characters are as thinly conceived as figures in a television pilot, and it is hard to believe that the four of them and Ms. Allen add up to a family. SCOTT Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE BRAVERY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. This cheerfully ridiculous neo-wave band comes armed with plenty of pseudo-disco basslines and gobs of eye makeup. This combination has earned the band a bunch of fans and perhaps an even bigger (or, at any rate, more vocal) bunch of detractors, including the lead singer of another neo-wave band, the Killers. For entertainment's sake, here's hoping some detractors sneak in among the fans during this concert -- rock bands don't get booed often enough. Sunday night at 8, with Ash and alaska!; tickets -- $16 in advance, $18 at the door -- are sold out, but returns may be available. KELEFA SANNEH T BROUSSARD AND THE ZYDECO STEPPERS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212) 576-1155. Bryant (T) Broussard has Lousiana musicians on both sides of his family. He's the accordionist and singer of a hard-working zydeco band. This show on Sunday, presented by Let's Zydeco, starts with dance lessons at 1:30 followed by the band from 2:30 to 6; admission is $18. JON PARELES CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Marc Anthony Thompson, aka Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes, ambling amid rock and rhythm-and-blues. His husky voice brings long-suffering passion to his twilit ballads. But between songs, he lets loose a sly and uninhibited sense of humor. Tomorrow night at 9:30, with Alice Smith opening; tickets are $15. PARELES DAMON AND NAOMI, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Damon and Naomi used to be in Galaxie 500, and on their own they have held onto the old group's hushed tone and searching simplicity; their group includes Kurihara from the Japanese band Ghost. Sunday night at 7, with Adrian Crowley and the writer Rick Moody, doing a reading, opening. Admission is $12. PARELES DJ LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALLSTARS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. This party imported from Miami puts a disc jockey together with live musicians, mixing Latin rhythms with electronic beats. Tomorrow night, midnight to dawn; admission is $10. PARELES OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street (212) 239-2672. Oscar D'Leon, a suavely forceful singer and a bass-twirling bandleader from Venezuela, leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 1980's salsa. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m., trading sets with Raffy Matias; admission is $25. PARELES C. GIBBS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. Christian Gibbs, who played lead guitar for Modern English and Foetus before starting his own bands, never settles down. As his lyrics detail surreal and troubled visions, with titles like ''Oversized Pin Cushion'' and ''Superficial Flesh Wound,'' the music wanders amid countryish rock, cracked cabaret oom-pah and elaborate, Beatles-flavored ballads. Tonight's first set starts at 10; free. PARELES CHARLIE GRACIE, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. In 1957, Charlie Gracie was a rockabilly singer from Philadelphia whose hit, ''Butterfly,'' topped Elvis Presley on the charts. Years later, he still works his guitar hard. Tomorrow night's first set is at 10; free. PARELES THE KLEZMATICS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all of them to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. They carry klezmer's itinerant, idea-gathering spirit all the way into present-day New York City. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door. PARELES MEGACONCIERTO 2005, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741. Watch Latin pop change generations and demographics, as the Puerto Rican salsa and pop singer Victor Manuelle shares a bill with the reggaeton rapper Don Omar; the Dominican merengue singer Toño Rosario; the Dominican bachata singer Frankie Reyes and the vocal group Aventura, which adds socially aware lyrics and touches of rhythm-and-blues to bachata; and Jorge Celedon, who sings accordion-driven Colombian vallenatos. Tonight at 8; tickets are $59.50 to $99.50. PARELES MOFRO/CYRO BAPTISTA AND BEAT THE DONKEY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. Mofro, a pair of guitarists from Florida, play bluesy songs that revel in swampy roots. Cyro Baptista, a Brazilian percussionist who's fond of melody and humor as well as rhythm, leads a troupe of percussionists and dancers in Beat the Donkey, his 10-member mini-carnival, playing instruments and rhythms that are both traditional and newly concocted. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15 in advance, $18 at the door. PARELES * NELLY , the Theater at Madison Square Garden, 7th Avenue at 32nd Street, (212)465-6741. Still counting the money from his ambitious and charming recent pair of albums, ''Sweat'' and ''Suit'' (Universal), Nelly comes to town to celebrate his continuing success -- and, perhaps, his neat feat of making a video (''Over and Over,'' with the country star Tim McGraw) that plays on both BET and CMT. He is to be joined by a strong line-up of rappers: the energetic heavyweight Fat Joe and, best of all, the slick but ferocious Atlanta kingpin T.I. Tonight at 8, tickets are $45.50 to $75.50. SANNEH NINA NASTASIA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. In her clear voice, Nina Nastasia sings visions of desolation and unflinching love -- ''dirty hands and dirty feet and all'' -- with melodies that can hint at the symmetries of Appalachian music and a homespun backup from instruments like accordion and banjo. Tomorrow night at 8, with Richard Milner opening; tickets are $12. PARELES OF MONTREAL, Northsix, 66 North 6th Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Of Montreal, which emerged with the Elephant Six collective of neo-psychedelic bands in Athens, Ga., plays giddy, optimistic, harmonically rambling songs by Kevin Barnes, who's clearly a Beach Boys and Beatles fan. Tomorrow night at 9 with St. Thomas and the Bluffs opening; admission is $10. PARELES * ONEIDA, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. Oneida, a New York band, leans hard on the keyboard-driven minimal rock of the early 1980's for songs that are joyfully relentless. It revs up frantic, obsessive patterns to carry thoughts about history, sex, drugs, rock and roll and a dystopian future, with a drive that's both obsessive and ecstatic. Tomorrow night at 11:30, with Magnolia Electric Co. and Oakley Hall opening; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow. PARELES * THE SCUMFROG, the Sullivan Room, 218 Sullivan Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)252-2151. This party celebrates the three year anniversary of this cozy dance club. The headliner is the Scumfrog, a house producer and D.J. who pays tribute to disco in his own weird way, emphasizing dirty synthesizer lines and tinny vocals; the result is an appealing, free-floating sleaziness. Tonight at 10, with Alex Pearce, Kind Nick and 3 Speaker High; admission is $15. SANNEH SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra: They're the virtuosic journeymen who are one of New York City's great musical resources. As the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, they reclaim salsa classics under the direction of the keyboardist Oscar Hernandez, who has worked with Ruben Blades and Paul Simon. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 and $35. PARELES ROD STEWART, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900. The soulful scratch in Rod Stewart's voice has carried him through boozy rock, rootsy coming-of-age tales, nostalgic rock and, lately, standards. He's unafraid to be a self-parody as long as it pleases the crowds. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 to $95. PARELES * JESSE SYKES AND THE SWEET HEREAFTER, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A cold wind seems to blow through Jesse Sykes' voice as her songs face desolation and mortality, while her band, the Sweet Hereafter, plays in poised slow motion. There's country in the music, with brushes on the drums and pedal-steel guitar wafting in from above; there's also a sighing viola and a touch of surf-guitar reverb. It's spellbound music, rapt in fatalism and sorrow. Tomorrow night at 11, with Great Lake Swimmers at 10, the M's at 9 and Jennifer O'Connor at 8; admission is $12. PARELES * DANNY TENAGLIA, Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- dance music D.J.'s. At this party celebrating, um, a party he threw a year ago, expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to house music (from clattering rhythm-only tracks to sleek electronic confections), but for his extraordinary stamina, too. Tonight at 11; tickets are $30 in advance, $40 at the door. SANNEH PAUL VAN DYK, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. When this wildly popular German progressive-house producer and D.J. comes to town, you can expect a precise set full of the usual dancefloor-pleasing devices: heroic synthesizer lines, sudden (or gradual) volume changes and lots of wooshing sounds. Tonight after 10; tickets are $40 in advance, $50 at the door. SANNEH Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed musician and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum. (An $80 dinner-and-show package is available.) STEPHEN HOLDEN * BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. HOLDEN * DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This singer's brilliant but exhausting two-hour show, ''J'ai Deux Amours,'' makes a compelling case that every American performer would profit by taking an extended sabbatical in Paris. That's where Ms. Bridgewater has lived for the last two decades. Her expatriate perspective encouraged the one-time rhythm-and-blues singer from Flint, Mich., to refine the far-flung musical vocabulary that infuses this bilingual program of mostly familiar, mostly French-originated pop songs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30 (tickets: $65), and Sunday at 7:30 (tickets: $50); all shows have a two-drink minimum. HOLDEN Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. KENNY BARRON SEXTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595; www.jalc.org. Mr. Barron, the pianist who has been a widespread presence in jazz over the last three decades, seeks out collaborators of various generations and styles and works energetically on the bandstand. This band includes Vincent Herring, Dayna Stephens, Eddie Henderson, Kiyoshi Kitigawa, and Victor Lewis. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, plus a $5 minimum at the bar, $10 at the tables. BEN RATLIFF * GEORGE CABLES PROJECT, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. With quiet intensity, Mr. Cables solidified his reputation as one of the best mainstream-jazz pianists during the 1970s; he doesn't lead bands in New York that often, so this is a chance to see him with a particularly good one, including the saxophonist Gary Bartz, bassist Eric Revis and drummer Jeff Watts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25. RATLIFF EDMAR CASTANEDA SEXTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. A young Colombian musician, Mr. Castaneda plays the harp, which has, obviously, rarely been used in jazz; but once you see his percussive technique you might wonder why this is so. Sets are Sunday at 8 and 10; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. For about eight years, the pianist Mr. Charlap has had a steady trio with the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington; his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation in the language of mainstream jazz -- the wonders of an organized, creative mind. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF CARLA COOK, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. A soulful singer who reaches outside jazz into pop and gospel to get what she needs; usually she has an excellent jazz group backing her up. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF ELI DEGIBRI QUARTET, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212)929-7565. A young tenor saxophonist from Israel, Mr. Degibri is starting to be known in New York; he commanded some attention when he toured with Herbie Hancock several years ago. Don't miss him. He is a very modern improviser, super-artful; his creations are spiky and fractured, but immaculately sculptured. With Ben Monder on guitar, Ben Street on bass, and Bill Stewart (today) or Adam Cruz (tomorrow) on drums. Shows begin at 10 p.m. Cover, $10 and there is a two-drink minimum. RATLIFF MARK FELDMAN-SYLVIE COURVOISIER/IKUE MORI, The Stone, Avenue C and 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com. Tonight at 8, the violinist Mr. Feldman and pianist Ms. Courvoisier play the music of John Zorn; at 10, Ikue Mori plays a solo show involving laptop computers and percussive electronics. Admission is $10. RATLIFF SHELLEY HIRSCH-ANTHONY COLEMAN/ELLIOTT SHARP ORCHESTRA CARBON CONDUCTED BY BUTCH MORRIS, The Stone, Avenue C and 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com. Tomorrow at 8, the vocalist Ms. Hirsch and the pianist Anthony Coleman play a program called ''In and Around Kurt Weill''; at 10, Mr. Sharp's 13-piece band, as well as the conductor Butch Morris, crams into the new club's little stage area to perform a piece called ''Quarks Swim Free.'' Admission is $10 per set. RATLIFF * DAVE HOLLAND BIG BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212) 581-3080. This big band is a relatively new 12-piece outgrowth of the bassist Mr. Holland's more widely known quintet. With the frighteningly well calibrated quintet, you know what you're going to get: careful compositions based on ostinatos, odd metered funk and counterpoint. The big band does more. Loud and fairly traditional, its arrangements for booming horn sections mix influences from postwar Count Basie and Duke Ellington, as well as Thad Jones; it's also music of a different temperature and mood, accommodating more slow tempos, along with some old-fashioned, take-your-time, knock-it-out-of-the-park solos. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40, minimum, $10 . RATLIFF * JAZZ COMPOSERS COLLECTIVE FESTIVAL, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. A worthy cooperative organization that has produced many concerts and brought forth a lot of good jazz records, the collective deserves your attention because of its tacit insistence on merging different approaches to playing and thinking about jazz -- as well as resurrecting old figures like Herbie Nichols and Lucky Thompson. Tonight, the pianist Frank Kimbrough's Trio, and the Herbie Nichols Project; tomorrow, Ben Allison's New Quartet, and a new band, the Lucky Thompson Project; Sunday, saxophonist Michael Blake's quartet. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF * 'JAZZ CUBANO REUNION' Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. The two young Cuban musicians Yosvany Terry (saxophones) and Dafnis Prieto (drums) get together with a few other mid-90's arrivals to New York's new Latin music scene -- the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Alex Hernandez. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF * KATE McGARRY QUINTET, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770. A lot of jazz singers are good at a few devices and punch them out song after song; Ms. McGarry, who is slowly becoming known around New York, has a deeper supply. You'll find shades of pop singers like Suzanne Vega and Rickie Lee Jones in her voice; you'll also find some of the highest refinements of great jazz singing. She has a breadth of material that runs from jazz standards to traditional Irish ballads to a version of the Kinks' ''(So) Tired of Waiting for You.'' Her new record is ''Mercy Street'' (Palmetto), and she'll be playing new material, with the pianist Fred Hersch as guest. Tonight at 7:30; cover charge is $15. RATLIFF * NEW ORLEANS JAZZ ORCHESTRA, DIRECTED BY IRVIN MAYFIELD, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. A 17-piece band from New Orleans led by the young, dynamic trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, who spends part of the year playing party music of the New World with Los Hombres Calientes and part of the year composing his own music, including the Wynton Marsalis-influenced suite ''Strange Fruit,'' just released on Basin Street records. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; remaining tickets are $100. RATLIFF TRIBUTE TO FRANK SINATRA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. A jazz musicians' gathering to honor the Voice, with contributions from the incomparable pianist Hank Jones, as well as Jim DiJulio, Mark Taylor, Eddie Bert, and others. Sets through Sunday are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $30, minimum, $5.

Opera 'CARMEN' Straightforward and streamlined, nipped and tucked to bring it in at three hours, City Opera's production of Bizet's classic seems livelier than it last did. Katharine Goeldner is a fine singer, and if the production didn't help her get far past your standard-issue Gypsy mannerisms, that was fine too. John Bellemer, a good-looking tenor with a soft-grained voice that sometimes hardens under strain, is singing his first performances with the company as a callow Don José; also new is Malcolm MacKenzie, an appropriately burly Escamillo. Gary Thor Wedow conducts, adequately. Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Remaining tickets: $32 to $65. ANNE MIDGETTE 'DON GIOVANNI' The Metropolitan Opera's successful revival of its year-old production of ''Don Giovanni'' is playing again tomorrow night. The company has assembled a gang of good Mozarteans though not always ones bearing big names. Gerald Finley and Tamar Iveri are very good as the Don and Donna Anna. Samuel Ramey takes the unaccustomed role of Leporello and does well with it. Michael Yeargan's sets are simple and to the point. Philippe Jordan is the bright young Swiss conductor. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215. BERNARD HOLLAND 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' The essentials of Puccini's opera are well-served in Mark Lamos's spare, attractive production, in which a magnified and uncluttered version of a traditional Japanese house fills the stage. A new cast joins the production tomorrow. The cast includes Marc Heller as Pinkerton, Jee Hyun Lin as Butterfly, Michael Corvino as Sharpless and Kathryn Friest as Suzuki. Atsushi Yamada conducts. Tonight at 8, New York City Opera, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $37 to $105. ALLAN KOZINN 'LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES' With Zandra Rhodes's vividly colored sets and faux-native costumes, New York City Opera's new production of Bizet's early, pretty and slightly sluggish opera set in ancient Sri Lanka evokes the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Mary Dunleavy, the Leïla, has a lovely clear soprano; Yeghishe Manucharyan, as Nadir, a small, pushed, but reasonably fluid tenor; and Emmanuel Plasson captures the languorous sensuality of the lovely music. Still, it's an opera in which not much happens, but takes a long time to do it. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570. Sold out, but returns may be available. MIDGETTE TOSCA. The young Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra made a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera in May of 2002, substituting for Luciano Pavarotti in Puccini's ''Tosca'' on what was assumed (incorrectly, it turned out) would be Mr. Pavarotti's farewell to the Met. On that night, Mr. Licitra, who was 33 at the time, seemed an immensely gifted tenor with an exciting but raw and unfinished voice. He is back at the Met for the first time since his dramatic debut, again as Cavaradossi in ''Tosca.'' Unfortunately, as an artist and singer he remains a work in progress. He still boasts a dusky-toned and powerful voice and sings with youthful energy and fervor. But he was vocally cautious on the first night of the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's 1985 production and his phrasing was sometimes labored. His Tosca, the veteran soprano Maria Guleghina, as is her way, sacrifices beauty of sound and lyrical elegance for the sake of hard-edged power and dramatic intensity. The veteran baritone Frederick Burchinal takes over the role of Scarpia. James Conlon conducts. Tonight at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $200. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In addition to championing forgotten composers, Leon Botstein and his orchestra have often presented fascinating but neglected music by figures we know well. Such is the case for this season-concluding program devoted to Richard Strauss's choral music, little known by even ardent Strauss admirers. Mr. Botstein will lead the orchestra and the Concert Chorale of New York in, among other works, ''Wanderers Sturmlied,'' ''Die Tageszeiten,'' and the ''Olympische Hymne,'' which Strauss conducted at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Sunday at 3, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53. JEREMY EICHLER ARTEK This early music ensemble is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, but it has changed greatly since its early days as a forum for Baroque keyboard works. Now its focus is more general, with vocal music -- especially vocal music that lends itself to dramatic presentation -- as a particular specialty. Even so, for old time's sake, the program tomorrow evening includes concertos for two harpsichords by J.S. Bach and two of his sons, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, and Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach. Gwendolyn Toth and Dongsok Shin are the harpsichord soloists, and the accompanying period instrument ensemble is to be conducted by Robert Mealy. The program also includes selections from J.S. Bach's Cantata No. 51 and an arrangement of Boccherini's ''Fandango,'' complete with castanets. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., St. Michael's Church, Amsterdam Avenue at 99th Street, (212)967-9157. Tickets: $20. KOZINN BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC They're calling it ''Brooklyn's Ode to Joy:'' the ever-struggling, ever-scrappy Brooklyn Phil is offering Beethoven's Ninth along with a new work the orchestra has commissioned, Jennifer Higdon's ''Dooryard Bloom,'' based on poems by a Brooklyn boy, Walt Whitman. The soloist in this first-ever performance of Ms. Higdon's piece is Nmon Ford; Michael Christie will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $60. MIDGETTE SARA DAVIS BUECHNER Besides being a nimble and elegant pianist, Sara Davis Buechner has a wide-ranging interest in overlooked repertory. Her Koch International recording of piano works by the operetta composer Rudolf Friml was an unexpected pleasure of 2003. So it's no surprise that the recital program she will play at the Greenwich House Music School tonight is rich with intriguing and little-known fare. After beginning with Mozart's Fantasy and Sonata in C minor, she offers works by Elliot Weisgarber, Yukiko Nishimura and Joaquin Turina. On Sunday afternoon she presents a master class at the school, open to the public. Recital tonight at 8; master class Sunday at 3 p.m.; Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212)242-4770. Tickets: $15, $10 for students for the recital; $7 for the master class. TOMMASINI CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER For its final program of the season, the Chamber Music Society offers the premiere of Lalo Schifrin's ''Letters From Argentina.'' The instrumentation (double bass and bandoneón joining a more typical chamber ensemble) and the composer's own description suggest an autobiographical work inspired by the aural memories of his Buenos Aires childhood, including tango and folk music. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48. EICHLER DAPONTE STRING QUARTET David Del Tredici has written operas and orchestral works and won a Pulitzer Prize, but until recently he had never written a string quartet. The impetus for changing that was the DaPonte Quartet, four Juilliard- and Peabody-trained players who went to Maine in the 1990's on a rural residency grant from Chamber Music America and ended up settling down there. ''Settling'' doesn't preclude ''concertizing,'' and the quartet, which has played around the country, is making its New York debut tonight with pieces by Schulhoff and Beethoven, as well as Mr. Del Tredici's Quartet No. 1 in its New York premiere. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30. MIDGETTE ENSEMBLE WIEN-BERLIN Compared to all those quartets and piano trios, woodwind chamber music seldom gets much time in the spotlight, but at least for this weekend the Ensemble Wien-Berlin will redress the imbalance. Consisting mainly of principal wind players (current and former) from the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, the group offers a ''Czech Winds Weekend'' with works by Dvorak, Janacek, Martinu, Pavel Haas and others spread over two programs. Tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $35. EICHLER FESTIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION WINNERS Big competition victories no longer guarantee professional success or even much exposure. The Metropolitan Museum is therefore trying to reward selected winners by presenting them in recital, in several cases for the first time in this country. The five remaining programs in this series will take place throughout the weekend: Severin von Eckardstein plays tonight at 8; Boris Giltburg is tomorrow at 3 p.m.; Alexei Grynyuk plays tomorrow night at 8; Giuseppe Albanese is Sunday at 3 p.m.; and Antti Siirala closes the festival Sunday night at 8. Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20 each, or $80 for all concerts. EICHLER FELICITY LOTT AND ANGELIKA KIRCHSCHLAGER Schumann's song cycle ''Frauenliebe und -leben,'' settings of poems by the German Romantic poet Adelbert von Chamisso that deal with the lives and loves of women, is a landmark of the song repertory that is probably performed too often for its own good. But the soprano Felicity Lott and the mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager have found what looks to be a fresh way to present that work in context with other songs dealing with themes of a woman's life from girlhood to old age. The less familiar setting of the Chamisso poems by Karl Loewe will also be performed, along with songs by Brahms and Mendelssohn, all dealing with themes of women. Graham Johnson is the pianist. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48. TOMMASINI VIKTORIA MULLOVA This Russian violinist won the Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982, but earned bigger headlines when she defected to the West not long afterward. She is an energetic, focused player who some listeners find chilly and others virtuosic and precise. But her partner in this recital is the French pianist Katia Labèque, a firebrand (and sometime jazz pianist), and it's hard to imagine Ms. Labèque signing on for a performance that threatens to be icy. The repertory includes a couple of novelties -- Clara Schumann's Romance in D flat and a work by an English composer, Dave Maric -- along with Stravinsky's ''Suite Italienne,'' Schubert's Fantasy in C (D. 934) and the Ravel Violin Sonata. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $74. KOZINN NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Riccardo Muti, who usually can't get enough of his homeland, must be relieved to get away from Italy for the moment, after the travails leading up to his resignation as music director of the Teatro Alla Scala in Milan on April 2. New Yorkers have taken a special interest in the fracas, since the Philharmonic, which courted Mr. Muti avidly but vainly before hiring Lorin Maazel, will, barring any further extension of Mr. Maazel's contract, soon be back in the market to replace him in 2009. Here Philharmonic audiences will get another look and listen at close hand, as Mr. Muti conducts Liszt's ''Faust Symphony'' and a work by Goffredo Petrassi. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90. JAMES R. OESTREICH 'SEPTETS AND OCTETS' This is the last in a series of concerts at the Miller Theater that has been pairing masterworks from the chamber music repertory with comparably great works from the 20th and 21st centuries. Tomorrow night's program presents Schubert's popular Octet in F with Schoenberg's inventive Septet Suite in E flat, Op. 29. The starry roster of performers, many of whom play regularly with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, includes, in part, the clarinetist Charles Neidich, the hornist William Purvis, the violinist Ida Kavafian, the cellist Fred Sherry and the pianist Christopher Oldfather. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $25. TOMMASINI ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA With his orchestra's labor problems in abeyance, David Robertson brings the St. Louis Symphony to Carnegie Hall. The talented Mr. Robertson is American and relatively young, and his program reflects both situations. The music of Ives begins and ends the evening with first ''The Unanswered Question'' and last the Second Symphony. In between come Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait'' with none other than Paul Newman as narrator and John Adams's ''Century Rolls.'' St. Louis seems eager to have Mr. Robertson, and it offers him an excellent place to learn the American orchestra business at his own pace. Sometimes the right people find each other at the right time. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $82. HOLLAND ANNE SOFIE VON OTTER You can not brand classical music as elitist when there are so many free or affordable concerts to take in all over New York, notably the ''Free for All at Town Hall'' series. On Sunday afternoon this essential series of free concerts presents the rich-voiced and intelligent mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter in a recital program with the pianist Bengt Forsberg, her longtime colleague. The program offers songs by Mozart, Haydn and Schubert as well as Haydn's solo cantata ''Arianna a Naxos.'' Interspersed among the vocal works Mr. Forsberg will play solo pieces by J.C. Bach and Schubert. Sunday at 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)707-8787. Tickets are available for free (two per person) at the Town Hall box office starting at noon. TOMMASINI Dance A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event.

DUNNING * HAROLD (STUMPY) CROMER AND FRIENDS Mr. Cromer, who has been tap-dancing since 1929, will be joined by Megan Haungs, Traci Mann and Toes Tiranoff, with Frank Owen on the piano, in ''The Truth Lies Here,'' a salute to April. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Cobi's Place, 158 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (516)922-2010. Tickets: $20. DUNNING CHRIS FERRIS AND DANCERS A concert of five dances created within the last two years features dynamic movements within intricate spatial designs. Ms. Ferris's pieces explore contrasts between improvised and set choreography, the way interruptions cause a bouncing sequence to grow erratic and differences between falling into partners' arms and falling to the floor. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham, Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (718)672-6965. Tickets: $15. JACK ANDERSON FLAMENCO LATINO You don't have to be Spanish to dance flamenco. That might be the motto of the company, directed by Aurora Reyes and Basilio Georges, which will perform in the closest thing they could find to a taverna. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11 p.m., Alegrias at La Nacional, 239 West 14th Street, West Village, (212)399-8519. Admission: $10 cover charge. DUNNING * MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY The current crop of Graham dancers may not look like the ones who originated their roles in the dances from the 1930's into the 50's that will be performed this weekend. These are different times. But this generation suggests that Graham's choreography can be simultaneously exalting and entertaining, particularly in Program B (tonight and Sunday afternoon). In this closing weekend, the company will present a family matinee tomorrow with a post-performance ''Meet the Dancers'' session Martha Clarke's new ''Suenos'' may be seen, along with Graham pieces, tomorrow and Sunday nights. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212)581-1212. Tickets: $24 to $80. DUNNING NEIL GREENBERG Mr. Greenberg's new ''Partial View,'' with music by Zeena Parkins and video by John Jesurun, isn't quite so magical as his last video and dance piece. But it is handsome looking and begins with a haunting solo danced by the choreographer. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25; $15 for students and 65+. DUNNING * LINCOLN CENTER 'NEW VISIONS': TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY This trend-setting modern-dance troupe will celebrate its 35th anniversary with two programs. The first (tonight) explores Ms. Brown's choreographic collaborations with Robert Rauschenberg. The second (tomorrow night) includes two New York premieres and the recent ''Geometry of Quiet.'' Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Rose Hall, Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500 or www.lincolncenter.org. Tickets: $45. DUNNING DAVID NEUMANN Mr. Neumann, one of downtown dance's most intriguing performers, teams up in his new ''tough, the tough'' with the filmmaker Hal Hartley and the playwright Will Eno in a work that ''exposes the cognitive maps and geopolitical boundaries that define imaginary landscape inside us and out.'' Consider yourselves warned, possums. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194. Tickets: $15 or TDF voucher. DUNNING * NEW YORK THEATER BALLET A discreet little pearl in the oyster of New York dance this weekend, the program features such little known works as Frederick Ashton's 1930 ''Capriol Suite,'' Antony Tudor's ''Main Gauches'' and ''Judgment of Paris,'' Sallie Wilson's ''Romeo and Juliet'' balcony scene and Ron Sequoio's ''Rondo for Seven,'' as well as a tribute to Bobby Short by Lois Bewley and a new ballet by company member Danielle Genest. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7:30 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. Tickets: $30; $15 for students and 65+. DUNNING NORANEWDANCECO Nora Stephens, a choreographer and video artist, collaborates with composers Ryan Smith and Jeff Snyder on a multimedia program featuring ''Finding You When,'' a new work that concerns connections and misconnections during the course of a lifetime. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (917)843-9470. Tickets: $12. ANDERSON * NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE A company established in 1990 to preserve India's 2000-year old dance traditions offers a program featuring Odissi, the oldest of India's classical dance forms performed by an ensemble of six dancers, three instrumentalists and a singer. Originally a sacred ritual, Odissi conveys spirituality through a sensuous flow of movement marked by lyrical curving gestures that bring to life ancient Indian sculptures. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38. ANDERSON LESLIE SATIN AND DANCERS A choreographer known for her rigor offers the premiere of ''Under Cover,'' a collaboration with the video artist Andrew Gurian that evokes a mysterious disturbing moment through a succession of elusive details. The production features three dancers; Iris Rose, an actress who recites a complex text by Ms. Satin, and Roy Nathanson, a saxophonist. Tonight and Sunday at 8, Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Manhattan,(212)924-7882. Tickets: $15. ANDERSON * STREB S.L.A.M. Ms. Streb's Frequent Flyers -- she's not kidding -- will soar, crash and dodge through dances new and familiar for two more weeks at her Brooklyn studio-theater. Popcorn served. Tonight and tomorrow at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m. Through May 1., S.L.A.M., 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)384-6491. Tickets: $15 adults; $10 children; free for children under 4.

Tonight (contemporary dance round) from 6 to 11 p.m.; tomorrow (classical ballet round) from noon to 10 p.m.; Sunday (final round) from 5 to 7 p.m., Martin Luther King High School Auditorium, Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street, Manhattan.

The competition ends with a gala in which winners perform with dancers from companies including the Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and MOMIX. Monday at 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212. Tickets: $15 to $100. DUNNING Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression, the emotions that reveal themselves after her best pictures leave their first impression, which is often alarm. She captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and -- this probably applies as much to Arbus as to any other photographer of the second half of the last century -- she captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some maddeningly dark, dense and absurdly theatrical galleries, like chapels, of memorabilia. That said, it touches her favorite subjects with grace. Even the shocking photographs of retarded women are sympathetic, implying that the world is full of wondrous things, if our eyes are open enough to recognize them, and that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; students, $7 and 65+, $10. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 88th Street, (212)423-3500, through June 8. The latest artist to be given Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim to play with, Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering construction, 81 feet tall, the corner of what would be a cube large enough to enclose the rotunda, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections, which predictably shift and shimmy in slightly queasy-making fashion along with your movement up or down the ramp. There is not much to the work beyond that. The museum's ramps are empty. Alternative panes of the circular skylight are colored with magenta gels, making a kind of checkerboard pattern. This is pretty. Short kelly-green stripes of tape are stuck below the outside rim of the rotunda's parapet. These are not attractive. A suite of Mr. Buren's colored striped paintings from the late 1960's and 70's are eccentrically aligned, Salon style, on adjacent walls of the museum's High Gallery and reflect through the gallery's doorway in the mirrors. They are at once boring and precious. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10. KIMMELMAN 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street (212)501-3000, through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, Historic New England (formerly the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities), appear in this show, from such humble objects as a relic box containing two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait (1793) of Richard Codman, a handsome profligate from Boston known for his wit, charm and lavish spending. What makes the show different from hundreds of others devoted to American antiques is that, thanks in no small part to bright captioning, it does convey a sense of family connection with the objects. And it gets into the 20th century with modernist furnishings from the Massachusetts home of Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, who left Hitler's Germany in 1938 for a teaching post at Harvard. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $3. GRACE GLUECK SUE DE BEER, 'BLACK SUN,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (800)944-8639, through June 24. Shown in a simplified, walk-in, pink castle, ""Black Sun"" is a Paul McCarthyesque video projected on two screens about teenage girlhood that alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. Though it is tempered by irony, the psychological urgency suggests that Ms. de Beer, who is in her early 30's, is still wrestling with her own adolescent conflicts about being good, being bad and being loved. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: free. KEN JOHNSON * 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA', Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400 and at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows, Corona Park, Queens, (718)592-9700 both through June 5. Also, ""Fatal Love: South Asian American Art Now,"" Queens Museum of Art through June 5. ""Edge of Desire,"" spread over two venues, is a highly selective, multi-generational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India. The senior figure here, K.G. Subramanyan, born in 1924, has over the years embraced craft, folk, and tribal traditions, as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The show does the same in work from mid-career figures like Nalini Malani and Vivan Sundaram, to newcomers like Shilpa Gupta, Swarna and Manu Chitrakar, and L.N. Tallur. The smaller portion of the show is at Asia Society; the more expansive and varied section in Queens. Also in Queens is ""Fatal Love,"" a lively but subtle showcase of young artists, many of them women, many living in New York. This show alone is worth a trip to Flushing Meadows. Park Avenue location hours: Tuesdays through Sundays 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; 65+, $7; students with ID, $5; members and under 16, free. HOLLAND COTTER ""MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE"" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through July 10. Max Ernst (1891-1976) is one of modernism's mystery men. He is everywhere in the history of European art between the wars, closely associated with two of the century's wild-and-craziest movements, Dada and Surrealism, yet he never quite materializes. Both despite and because of his elusiveness he remains an artist of some interest, and there are intriguing things in this large survey. They range from some of the earliest paintings to be officially labeled Surrealist, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to examples of the collage-style books some consider Ernst's masterworks. On the positive side, his refusal of a signature style is evidence of his anti-authoritarian instincts. Too often, however, it produced art that looks like brilliant busywork. Only when he is responding to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. Hours and admission: see above. COTTER * TIM HAWKINSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Tim Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. Each requires some head-scratching decipherment, inviting admiration for its doggedness, while not straining too hard to earn a viewer's love. Feats of physical fancy, when so dizzily executed, can be their own justification. Mr. Hawkinson's larger purpose, you might say, is simply wonderment. At the same time the art borrows a healthy strain of ludicrous wit from Samuel Beckett, who knew a thing or two about how to clown around smartly. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Friday 1 to 9 p.m.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50; children 12 and under, free. KIMMELMAN * 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' Solomon R. Guggeheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through May 11. For his Guggenheim solo show, Rikrit Tirvanija, winner of the 2004 Hugo Boss prize, has built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials in one of the museum's galleries, and papered the walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same. What looks like a glorified science-fair project comes with specific social context. The airwaves, which carry transmissions, are technically United States government property. Unlicensed broadcast is illegal and licenses are hard to get. Federal control of its communications resources has further tightened in recent years, inspiring a wave of illegal transmissions from stations like this one, which could contribute to grassroots protest against perceived restrictions on first amendment rights. Here, Mr. Tiravanija's art-linked-to-life aesthetic moves outside the art-world to the real world, a significant, potentially far-reaching shift. Hours and admission: see above. COTTER 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street (212)832-1155, through July 24. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture and its high incidence of mushroom clouds, bionic heroes, building-crunching monsters and hyper-cute cartoon characters. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami (of Vuitton bag fame), and organized in collaboration with the Public Arts Fund, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced the work of younger artists like Yoshitomo Nara, Chinatsu Ban and the artist currently known as Mr. ROBERTA SMITH 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, through June 6. More than 100 faces make up the cast of this show. The portraits were shot by 35 photographers active in the two countries, among them Lotte Jacobi, Josef Albers, Gisele Freund, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and August Sander. Their images not only give a sense of the rich cultural life in Austria and Germany before the Nazis but also help trace the history of photography during the period. More important, this savvy show homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. GLUECK * 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212)570-3676, through May 8. Despite the ""works on paper"" label, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, when Mr. Twombly, closely entwined with the artist Robert Rauschenberg, developed a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was a form draftsmanship, gouging and scratching was gestural painting. After moving to Italy, words appeared frequently in the work: obscenities, the names of gods, quotations from Roman epics, scraps of Romantic poetry. It was as if Western cultural history was unfolding on the walls of a toilet stall. Closer to the present the work turns lush and perfumed, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is both appetizing and uningratiating. Hours and admission: see above. COTTER Galleries: Uptown PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE,' Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragi-comic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. His small, brushy and comparatively sentimental paintings are disappointing, but there are fewer of them. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo * '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. This fascinating and beautiful exhibition presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. The Swedish af Klimt and the Swiss Kunz were mystics for whom drawing was a way to represent or channel supernatural dimensions of the universe. Martin, on the other hand, was a Modernist more interested in the Zen-esque experience of the here and now in art and nature. JOHNSON Galleries: Chelsea ERIC FISCHL, Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212)752-2929, through April 23. Like the ones in his last show at this gallery, Mr. Fischl's paintings are based on his own photographs of hired models behaving like jaded sophisticates during a daytime love-making session or at home after a late night party. The paintings are suavely made with wide brushes in muted colors and they capture complex patterns of light broken up by venetian blinds. But a frustrating vagueness about what is going on in the pictures limits the psychological intrigue. JOHNSON MARK HEYER, Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through April 23. Mr. Heyer's small, folksy narrative paintings of subjects like a tornado approaching a Midwestern farm, a circus act under the big top and sexy women getting dressed in their rooms look as if they were made in the 1920's and 30's by a simple-minded colleague of Edward Hopper and Charles Burchfield. That they are actually clever Postmodernist simulations does not prevent them from being nostalgically enchanting. JOHNSON 'IAN KIAER: THE GREY CLOTH' Tanya Bonakdar Gallery 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea (212)414-4144, through April 30. Inspired by a little-known 1914 novel by the German architecture critic Paul Scheerbart, the five installation pieces in this show work quite well as a neurasthenic environment whose arrangements of pale monochromes and pale found objects abjectly elegize the building blocks of modernism. SMITH JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE,' Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through April 30. Born in Lithuania in 1922, Mr. Mekas survived a Nazi forced labor camp to become one of the most influential and revered members of the New York avant garde film-making community. This retrospective sampler presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the past five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family, a piece that was inspired by an idea of Ferdinand Leger's. JOHNSON HERVÉ DI ROSA: 'THE SOLO GROUP SHOW,' Haim Chanin, 210 Eleventh Avenue at 24th Street, (646)230-7200, through April 23. An antic chameleon of an artist, this French Neo-Popster presents more than 500 small, framed paintings and drawings in four large clusters. Mr. di Rosa's ability to imitate many different styles -- including underground comics, geometric abstraction, Surrealism and realism -- is impressive, but it is the gleeful irreverence and love of absurdity holding it all together that wins you over. JOHNSON MAGNUS VON PLESSEN, Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street (212)206-9300, through April 23. In the artist's eagerness to suggest fluctuating moods and rapid shifting of perceptions, and to avoid the ""literalness"" that painting can fall into, he puts down fugitive images (often derived initially from photographs) that are done in by paint or the lack of it. One example is ""Discontinued,"" a large teetery structure that amounts to a suggestion of a building with most of its vitals left out. Paint, or its strategic omission, the artist seems to say, trumps imagery. In more talented hands, this is often true, but not here. GLUECK Last Chance JOHN ALTOON: 'PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS, 1961-67,' Luise Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)343-2161, closing tomorrow. In the last years of his short life, Altoon (1925-1969) broke out of the freewheeling West Coast mode of Abstract Expressionism to zero in on more personal images -- some dreamy, others explicitly sexual, still others biomorphic doodles -- that floated through his fantasy. One of the most amusing -- and accessible -- of these works is ''Untitled (Bathtub)'' of 1967. It depicts a woman bathing as a poodle awaits her emergence. But her attention is riveted on a small demonic man who has set fire to her bath water. Altoon's deft, light touch mates well with his fine sense of the silly. GLUECK ALYSON SHOTZ, 'MOMENT IN TIME AND SPACE,' Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-6411, closing tomorrow. This resourceful sculptor has hung an expansive, undulating, floor-to-ceiling curtain in the middle of the gallery. It was made by stapling together thousands of ovals cut from plastic magnifying sheets. The kaleidoscopic optical effects are delightfully confounding. JOHNSON STANLEY WHITNEY, Esso, 531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)560-9728, closing tomorrow You might not have thought the tired old genre of grid-based abstract painting still had in it works as buoyantly radiant as these. Painted with a dry, flat and slightly brushy touch, Mr. Whitney's blocks of near-pure color, separated by horizontal bands like books on a bookshelf, have a syncopated chromatic rhythm that is a pleasure to behold.

"Rounding Up the Best of the Boxed; Duke Ellington -- The Complete 1936-1940 Variety, Vocalion and Okeh Small Group Sessions",2006-11-24,"In 1936 Duke Ellington had been leading a big band for a little more than 10 years and he was an international star, possibly the highest-paid black entertainer in the United States. At this point he undertook a series of small-group sessions. Some of the standout tracks: ''Tough Truckin','' ''Indigo Echoes,'' ''Love in My Heart,'' ''Pyramid'' ''Chasin' Chippies'' and ''Delta Mood.'' None of them are very famous; most are based on the templates of better-known Ellington songs. They are all marked by Ellingtonian arrangement methods, and in many places the band just flies. Most of these weren't issued as Ellington records. The most prominent of his sidemen -- Johnny Hodges, Cootie Williams, Barney Bigard -- were listed as bandleaders; on one session, the trumpeter Rex Stewart, new to the Ellington organization, was drafted as leader. (He ended up spending nine years with the band.) Why did this happen? To keep great, underpaid, underrecognized musicians with him for the long haul, Ellington needed strong diplomatic skills. And, it seems, making cheaper list-price records that could be aimed more directly at jukeboxes was also a factor. A hit kept the experiment going: ''Caravan,'' from 1936, the first and very widely heard version of it.",4fd254098eb7c8105d7fb1fc,264
"Bossa Nova From the Source, Jazzed-Up Jazz From Italy",2006-02-19,"Antonio Carlos Jobim Antonio Carlos Jobim grew famous through the first half of his life's work -- three-minute masterpieces he turned out by the dozen, into his 40's -- but it can be hard to get the full measure of him within them. Pop music is a mess of competing commercial interests, and the gifts of a great composer working in pop can be obscured. For some listeners, Jobim as composer has been overshadowed by the interpretations of João Gilberto, who originated voice-and-guitar bossa nova, remains the king of it and performs Jobim's songs so authoritatively that it can seem as if he wrote them. Many others know Jobim's work through Stan Getz's records in the early 60's, but those are Stan Getz records. Two of Jobim's most famous albums were collaborations with Frank Sinatra (1967) and Elis Regina (1974); in both cases, the other person was the superior singer and took the reins. But Jobim as composer, singer and musician comes through in a new three-disc reissue, ''The Prime of Antonio Carlos Jobim'' (DBK Works/Runt), incorporating three records he made for the American market between 1965 and 1967. Two of them, ''The Wonderful World of Antonio Carlos Jobim'' and ''A Certain Mr. Jobim,'' deserve new attention. Jobim composed songs fully, with a lot of harmony; the arrangers of these records, Nelson Riddle and Claus Ogerman respectively, don't intrude much on his vision. In both cases, the rhythm section is Brazilian, so it swings in the right way. Jobim sings shakily and in English, but this just humanizes his genius. And though he worried about being typecast as a South American bumpkin by playing guitar instead of piano on the records, he nailed that, too. Gianluca Petrella One of the challenges in current jazz is making studio records that break the mold of basic, what-you-hear-is-what-you-get, documentary-style affairs. (Perhaps it's better to say that it's a potential challenge, largely ignored.) European musicians are more up to this than Americans, and Gianluca Petrella, a young, adept Italian trombonist, has just raised the bar a bit. ''Indigo 4'' (Blue Note), his second album and his first American release, is a real jazz record, historically versed in Monk, Ellington and Sun Ra. There's swing, as well as individual identities in the quartet, and deft humor. But here and there, Mr. Petrella exercises subtle post-editing maneuvers: loops and sound effects and soft, glitchy, digital sounds. He keeps it simple, but it's an impressive move. Das Oath A great new self-titled EP by Das Oath, a band from New York and the Netherlands, sounds like hard-core punk as it was in the early 80's, but as only a few bands could muster it: it's musically confident but scraped down to basics, overdriven to the point of electrocution, the howled singing like a meditative drone. (I'm thinking Void, early Hüsker Dü, early Die Kreuzen.) It blasts through nine songs in 20 minutes, and that's all you need. (On Dim Mak Records, dimmak.com.) Omer Avital So we weren't crazy: finally, here's proof that Omer Avital's sextet, which played at Smalls to a small but deep following in the late 90's, really was good. ''Asking No Permission'' (Smalls Records), recorded there in 1996, is the first album to be released by that group. With Mr. Avital on bass, Ali Jackson on drums and four excellent tenor saxophonists (Mark Turner, Greg Tardy, Myron Walden and Charles Owens), the young band worked a lot and developed fast, dealing in a range of sounds from the World Saxophone Quartet to Warne Marsh to Ornette Coleman to early-60's Coltrane. For a little while, it was as good as any jazz group in New York, and Mr. Avital, in his mid-20's, wrote stronger tunes than those of many bandleaders with twice his experience. (Available from smallsrecords.com.) Duke Ellington Part of the pleasure of watching Duke Ellington on film is seeing how much he enjoyed working. In ''Ralph J. Gleason Celebrates Duke Ellington'' (Eagle Vision), a DVD combining two documentaries made in 1965 by Gleason, the San Francisco jazz critic, Ellington was 66 and still hyperproductive: writing loads of new music, working with his 15-piece band in clubs, making records with efficiency. The second documentary is a film of his first Sacred Concert; the first, ''Love You Madly,'' just tries to capture Ellington's ambient energy. In it he talks about deadlines as if they are his elixir; it's all a running boast, but his rap is beguiling. He wrote ''Black and Tan Fantasy,'' he claims, in a taxicab riding south through Central Park; ''Solitude'' was written ''in 20 minutes in Chicago standing up against a glass office enclosure waiting for another band to finish recording.'' But ''Sophisticated Lady,'' he admits, ''is one of the things I struggled with for a month.'' Prefuse 73 Guillermo Scott Herren, a producer, uses the name Prefuse 73 when he wants to make surreal hip-hop. ''Security Screenings'' (Warp) sounds as if it was made with a series of quick and deep strokes: it's a game of dream juxtapositions, but all the parts are well connected. Guitar, twinkling synth arpeggios, background tapes of talking and laughter, jazz-record samples, James Brown beats: Mr. Herren slices them all up mercilessly, making a different background for every single beat. What comes out is reconstituted, crazily hybrid, but still manages to flow; he doesn't abandon funk.",4fd2ab798eb7c8105d89812f,893

"Paid Notice: Deaths   BARRETTO, RAY",2006-02-21,"BARRETTO--Ray. It is with deep regret and sadness that the family of the legendary Ray Barretto announces that the acclaimed Conga Maestro died Friday, February 17, 2006. Mr. Barretto died at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ at 5 AM EST. His family was at his bedside. A leading force in both the Salsa and Latin Jazz worlds, Ray was one of the most prolific, influential and recorded Latin percussionists in the history of jazz and a pioneer in the world of salsa. His salsa aficionados and fans are represented throughout the world. The man popularly known as ''Hard Hands'' (Manos Duras) was raised in East Harlem and the Bronx, but was enthralled by the big band sounds of Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. During his military tour through Europe, the musical influence of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie claimed his attention at a GI jazz club. His world and his eventual global impact were never quite the same again. Just this past January, he received a most prestigious award from the National Endowment for the Arts for his legendary contributions to jazz. This is the highest honor that our nation bestows upon jazz musicians in recognition that this magnificent art form, so profoundly based in American culture, is one of America's greatest gifts to the world. Mr. Barretto is survived by his wife, Annette, their son, Chris (age 20), and Raun, Ray and Kelly from a former marriage.

''The Park Avenue Whirl,'' their collaboration at Feinstein's at the Regency, resurrects a pop-jazz style synonymous with simplicity and joy. Performed in an authentic period style, the propulsive sounds of 1920's and 30's jazz are among the happiest effusions of American music. It would take a book to answer the question ''why?'' As the Great Depression was deepening, why was the music so joyful? Was it merely a means of collective escape?

THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; FILM,2006-01-01,"The animation expert Greg Ford has put together a rousing program, CARTOON MUSICALS, that continues through Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater (www.filmlinc.com). Sunday brings Loony Esoterica and Merrie Marginalia, devoted to shorts with musical themes from the Warner Brothers cartoon studios. The great Carl Stalling was in charge of the musical elements, underlining the work of Bugs Bunny and associates with his highly distinctive musical cues and sly, punning references to pop hits in the Warner catalog. Showing Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 1 and 6:45 p.m. and Wednesday at 2:45 p.m., the program includes a typically elegant Friz Freleng study in musical synchronization, ''Stage Door Cartoon'' (1944), plus work by the directors Frank Tashlin (''Wholly Smoke''), Robert Clampett (''Naughty Neighbors'' and ''Polar Pals'') and Mr. Ford himself (''Blooper Bunny,'' with Terry Lennon as co-director). A program of George Pal's Puppetoons (Sunday at 4:15 p.m., Monday at 3:15 and Wednesday at 1 p.m. ) brings together some of the extremely polished stop-motion animation produced by Pal, including ''Rhapsody in Wood'' (1947), with music by Woody Herman's big band, and ''A Date With Duke'' (1947), set to an Ellington score.

But there are also worthy small-club gigs, and two are Monday night. A young jazz singer trained in the verities of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, SASHA DOBSON is starting to make music that's more about her own time; her album ''Modern Romance,'' to be released in August, includes covers of songs by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Duke Ellington, as well as her own pieces. The band, on the record and for her current live gigs, includes several colleagues of Norah Jones -- JESSE HARRIS, RICHARD JULIAN and TONY SCHERR -- as well as the percussionist MAURO REFOSCO.

Over the years, working his way up, he has played in some of the best jazz groups of the day, like Dave Holland's quintet and Paul Motian's Electric Bebop Band; these are groups marked by careful, defined sound, which he has been able to enhance, as the gestures in his playing became bigger and more authoritative. He avoids playing licks, using an imaginative, almost Wayne Shorter-like approach to improvisation. In this small gig he will have plenty of room, with only the bassist SCOTT COLLEY and the drummer JEFF BALLARD.

"Free-Form Experimentalism, With Swing",2006-03-23,"For the first 10 minutes of the ICP Orchestra's early set at Tonic on Tuesday night, the pianist Misha Mengelberg and the drummer Han Bennink indulged in an improvised duet, something they have been doing together for roughly 40 years. Their styles were complementary, if a bit bizarrely so. Mr. Mengelberg gave the impression of a man groping for the doorknob in a darkened room. Mr. Bennink occupied the same room, but with a different temperament, impatiently and heedlessly knocking things around. That somewhat comedic contrast has always characterized Mr. Mengelberg's rapport with Mr. Bennink; as an exploratory pair, they have as much in common with Laurel and Hardy as with Lewis and Clark. In 1967, they applied their collective energies to the formation of a Dutch avant-garde movement called the Instant Composers Pool, or ICP. (A third founding member, the multireedist Willem Breuker, left the organization within its first decade.) The ICP Orchestra, a flagship in a small fleet of like-minded projects, took shape in the early 1980's, with Mr. Mengelberg and Mr. Bennink at the helm.",4fd254838eb7c8105d7fb872,459

Stefon Harris,2006-10-21,"In jazz circles, few things convey studious sophistication more than the concert music of Duke Ellington. But if you really want to drive the point home, try orchestrating that music for a chamber ensemble, with woodwinds and strings. Then, as a tribute, compose some music for the same group, in a similar style. The vibraphonist Stefon Harris has done all of these things, with earnest diligence. His new album is ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note), and it leaves no doubt about his high regard for Ellington's softer side. But there is a lulling quality to some of his more rarefied interpretations; the album's strongest moments have a hint of ruggedness in their rhythm.

It marked the embarkation point of a quest: Mr. Weston has spent most of the last half-century promulgating a distinctly African approach to jazz, one shaped by ethnic folk traditions and rooted in spiritual concerns. Mr. Weston employed ''Zulu'' as an invocation on Tuesday night at the World Financial Center, teasing out its theme with a chordal rumble and an artfully halting cadence. Alone at the piano, he reached back to a formative influence, Thelonious Monk; one triplet cascade gave off a particular air of homage. In that moment, and in a burst of stride rhythm on the following tune, Mr. Weston offered a glimpse of the jazz pedigree that preceded his African exploration.",4fd2693e8eb7c8105d82044d,582

Echoes of an Era Offer a Common Language,2006-03-03,"Some fascinating tensions were rippling through the jazz world in 1963. Hard bop was fully ascendant and beginning to express the influence of free improvisation. Previous generations, from the swing and bebop eras, were still active and engaged. John Coltrane was recording music for the bedroom with the crooner Johnny Hartman, and music for a different sort of rapture with his quartet at Birdland. Miles Davis was piecing together his fiercely modern second quintet. It wasn't exactly 1963 again at the Jazz Standard on Wednesday night, but the historical echoes reverberated loud and clear. The vibraphonist Steve Nelson, taking one of his infrequent turns as a leader, was beginning a five-night run with a pickup quintet.

Black Humor,2006-01-22,"My introduction to black -- excuse me, Black -- literature happened during the summer between eighth and ninth grades when the Los Angeles Unified School District, out of the graciousness of its repressive little heart, sent me a copy of Maya Angelou's ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.'' It was the first book I'd ever opened written by an African-American author. Notice I said ''opened'' and not ''read.'' I made it through a few pages before I began to get suspicious. Why would a school district that didn't bother to supply me with a working pair of left-handed scissors, a decipherable pre-algebra text or a slice of pepperoni pizza with more than two pepperonis on it send me a new book? Why care about my welfare now?",4fd2ab768eb7c8105d897e55,1437
"A Master With a Mission, Despite Her Personal Trials",2006-01-27,"''I'm making you sing a little louder than you're used to, right?'' the legendary mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne asked, seeming very sympathetic. She was speaking to Kathryn Leemhuis, one of six young singers in her master class at Zankel Hall on Tuesday night. ''Well,'' Ms. Horne continued with good-natured bluntness, ''you should get used to it, honey. There is the small time, the medium time and the big time. This is the big time. 'Sing out, Louise!' '' The event was the first offering of ''The Song Continues 2006,'' the annual four-day presentation of master classes and concerts sponsored by the foundation Ms. Horne set up in 1993 to encourage and preserve the art of the vocal recital by presenting emerging singers in performances and educational programs around the country.",4fd263008eb7c8105d81556c,1433

The Corridor Is Cool Again,2006-04-14,"SAUNTER down U Street in northwest Washington almost any night and you'll hear the pulsing beat of urban nightlife: the tinny pop of a snare drum, the caustic sneering of an indie rocker, the smooth melodies of a lounge singer, the plaintive picking of a folkie and the driving chunk-a-chunk of hip-hop. The U Street Corridor, the center of Washington's African-American nightlife for much of the 20th century and the birthplace of Duke Ellington, is vibrant again and the newest and hottest place in town for getting out on weekends after dark. The transformation that began in the late 90's, after three decades of decline and neglect, continues to gather speed, with boarded-up buildings reopened and transformed into galleries, shops, cafes and clubs, and nightlife seekers migrating over from Georgetown and Adams Morgan for a slightly older, less raucous scene where the patrons have a bit more money to spend.",4fd2879b8eb7c8105d8596b5,1571
"The History of the World, Written by the Horn Section",2006-04-09,"LAST December, the veteran Mexican-American rock band Los Lobos dusted off its 1992 album ''Kiko'' and performed it live, start to finish, at the House of Blues in West Hollywood. For most of the night it was a standard rock setup, but when it came time for the album closer, a woozy Mexican folk swoon called ''Rio de Tenampa,'' Los Lobos brought out Los Cenzontles, a Northern California banda troupe. While Mexican bandas (brass bands) can have as many as 20 members, Los Cenzontles didn't need much more than a tuba, a trumpet, a thudding bass drum and a pair of clarinets to turn the club into a raucous cantina. Brass band music can have this effect. The stammering pepper-spray of horns, the crisp snaps of snare rolls: it's precise and excessive at once, a joyous emotional tornado awash in spit, sweat and celebration. No wonder it's one of the world's most-spoken musical languages -- from Serbian villages to Manhattan's bustling ''gypsy punk scene'' to this year's Grammy Awards, where Kanye West reinvented ''Gold Digger'' by having a marching band play, running through the aisles. Awareness of international brass styles has blossomed in recent years in the United States, thanks in large part to an increase in domestic album distribution deals and more frequent international concert tours.",4fd2ab838eb7c8105d898899,1624

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) 'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) *'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'J.A.P. CHRONICLES: THE MUSICAL' Isabel Rose, an energetic overachiever, wrote and performs this one-woman show based on her own novel. To her credit, she was willing to hack apart her book to make a viable work of theater, and belts out tunes that are catchy (if uninspired), but the result feels superficial, trafficking in the kinds of obvious stereotypes her background leads you to believe she'd like to challenge (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion (2:20). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A SPALDING GRAY MATTER' This darkly comic solo show, written and performed by Michael Brandt, tells the story of the playwright's own tragic sickness and recovery. It proves that aping Spalding Gray is not easy (1:10). The New Group at Theater Row, Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'COWBOYS!' This melodrama spoof with gay men at the Straight Arrow Ranch makes up for what it lacks in professionalism with a good-natured goofiness (2:10). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 627-2961. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'BRUNDIBAR' and 'BUT THE GIRAFFE, A CURTAIN RAISER TO HANS KRASA'S 'BRUNDIBAR' Hans Krasa's ''Brundibar,'' a lively opera for children, performed 55 times in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with a new English libretto by Tony Kushner and a curtain-raiser by him that explains its history. Maurice Sendak and Kris Stone designed the charming production (1:35). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' An eye-glazing attempt to resurrect Herman Wouk's 1953 courtroom drama, adapted from his novel ''The Caine Mutiny.'' Directed with metronome in hand by Jerry Zaks, and starring David Schwimmer, Tim Daly and Zeljko Ivanek, this workmanlike production gives few clues to the enduring appeal of Mr. Wouk's tale of a humdinger of a typhoon, some disappearing strawberries and a nut job memorably named Queeg (2:15). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'FAUST, PARTS 1 AND 2' David Herkskovits and his Target Margin Theater's remarkable performers offer the extravaganza promised in the publicity. Faust is a circus of operatic scale, a fun house, a tango of poetry and theatrical and sonic wizardry whose virtuosity renders this work in all its surging strangeness, power and extravagant beauty (6:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Honor Moore) 'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' This musical, based on a 1960 novel by Peter S. Beagle, tells of love in a cemetery that sounds a lot like Woodlawn in the Bronx. One set of would-be lovebirds is living, one recently deceased; the thin story needs a few more memorable songs. York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MARY STUART' An earnest but uninspired revival that never quite captures either the romance or the tragedy of Schiller's play. There are some bright spots, but the production appears aimed more at visual effect than dramatic substance, and both queens seem to have the idea that monarchs exert authority simply by speaking loudly (2:40). The Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Wilborn Hampton) 'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' The Acting Company's elegant, eloquent take on the familiar adventures of Dumas's likable swordsmen is a grand evening of theater (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (A. O. Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small- screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) 'WAH-WAH' (R, 97 minutes) Scored to the death rattle of the British Empire in Africa, ''Wah-Wah'' observes the disintegration of the Compton family through the eyes of its young son. In his writing and directorial debut, the actor Richard E. Grant probes the pungent details of his own childhood in Swaziland, vividly recreating a community steeped in boredom, booze and casual adultery. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Vincent and Theo'' (1990), about van Gogh's relationship with his brother; ''Three Women'' (1977), a study of gal pals with unusually deep emotional attachments; and ''The Player'' (1992), starring Tim Robbins, the satire that proves once and for all that in Hollywood the writers are dispensable. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.(Anita Gates) B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. ''Gun Crazy'' (1949), about a couple on a robbery spree, and ''The Big Combo'' (1955), about a cop determined to nail a Mafia boss, both directed by Joseph H. Lewis, play today and tomorrow. Sunday's double feature is ''Detour'' (1945), the adventures of a hitchhiker who commits identity theft, and ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), about a beautiful mob-trial witness and her cop bodyguard on a train. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) BOSNIAN-HERZEGOVINIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Two dozen feature, short and animated films will be screened at Anthology Film Archives in this three-day annual festival. The six films having their American premieres include ''Justice Unseen,'' about the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and ''Asim Free Man,'' the story of a garbage truck driver who finds solace by playing in a band. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (917) 302-2702; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Rashomon'' (1950), the director's classic drama about the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. The New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics and National Board of Review all named it best foreign film. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) RIPFEST 8 (Tuesday and Wednesday) This eighth annual festival, at Anthology Film Archives, consists of seven original 10-minute movie musicals made in the 16 days before their premieres. This year's theme is Desperate Measures. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; $15. (Gates) SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Through May 21) The Brooklyn Academy of Music is celebrating the Sundance Institute's 25th anniversary with a series of events, including screenings of films from this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The opening-weekend selections include Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary ''The Trials of Darryl Hunt,'' about a black man wrongly convicted of a white woman's rape and murder; So Yong Kim's ''In Between Days,'' the story of a Korean teenager trying to assimilate into American culture; ''Stephanie Daley,'' a drama about a pregnant forensic psychologist and a teenage girl accused of infanticide; and Goran Dukic's ''Wristcutters: A Love Story,'' a comedy about dead people. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films begins today at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include ''Menschen am Sonntag'' (1929), a neo-realist Weimar-era German silent with a screenplay by the young Billy Wilder; ''Bunny Lake Is Missing'' (1965), Otto Preminger's swinging-60's-London whodunit with Laurence Olivier and Carol Lynley; and two versions of ''The Mark of Zorro'' (1920 and 1940). Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALICE IN CHAINS (Tuesday) In the late 1980's and early 90's, Alice in Chains helped create the Seattle grunge sound by slowing bluesy metal riffs into a lavalike sludge. Now, four years after the death of its singer, Layne Staley -- whose mastery of the nasal snarl remains unmatched -- the surviving members are doing a short tour, with William Duvall in Mr. Staley's place. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Ben Sisario) THE BOOKS (Wednesday) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. At 8 p.m., Courtyard Gallery, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free, but tickets, available at 5 p.m., are required. (Sisario) COHEED AND CAMBRIA, AVENGED SEVENFOLD (Tonight and tomorrow night) With baroque progressive rock riffs that recall Rush, and liberal use of Roman numerals, the group Coheed and Cambria stands out from the painfully earnest emo scene. Avenged Sevenfold's machine-gun rhythms, bumblebee guitar solos and anthemic vocals make a more overt link to bygone metal, particularly that of Iron Maiden and early Metallica. At 7, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) DUB TRIO (Tuesday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk rock, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. This show celebrates the group's new album, ''New Heavy'' (ROIR), with the guests Dark Room, Beans and Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad. At 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Sisario) ERASURE (Tonight) This long-running British synth-pop group recently released ''Union Street'' (Mute), recreating some of its B-sides and other lesser-known songs on dobro, pedal steel and nylon-string guitars, prettily but kind of dully. Expect the same at this acoustic show. At 8, New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) * GNARLS BARKLEY (Monday) One of the most eagerly anticipated concerts this year is by this brilliantly nutty duo featuring the producer-alchemist Danger Mouse and the helium-voiced singer and rapper Cee-Lo Green. Their album ''St. Elsewhere'' (Downtown/Atlantic) giddily tosses together gospel modulations, gorgeous soul, sensory-overload beats and a jumble of pop-culture references. (Surely this is the first hip-hop cover of the Violent Femmes' ''Gone Daddy Gone.'') ''Maybe we're crazy,'' Cee-Lo sings. ''Probably.'' At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) * ZAKIR HUSSAIN'S MASTERS OF PERCUSSION (Tomorrow) The renowned tabla player Zakir Hussain's annual percussion musicales are leisurely, smiley gatherings, but there is no slacking in the music -- the improvisational give-and-take and deft timing are amazing to behold. This year's guests include the dancing drummers of Manipuri Jagoi Marup, the sarangi player Ustad Sultan Khan and the sitar player Niladri Kumar. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536; $25 to $35. (Sisario) * SHARON JONES (Tomorrow) The brawny-voiced singer Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the sound of Stax and other beloved 1960's soul labels. Her repertory includes a righteously funky reading of ''This Land Is Your Land.'' Joining her are Binky Griptite, the Budos Band, Naomi Davis and the Gospel Queens, the Mighty Imperials and Antibalas. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) KANDA BONGO MAN (Tonight) Kanda Bongo Man smoothly croons his songs, as his band plays the gleaming, intertwining guitar lines and lilting rumba rhythms of Congolese soukous. At 11:30, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25.(Jon Pareles) THE NATIONAL (Sunday) This Brooklyn group has built a significant following with flawless, wilting ballads featuring subtly inventive guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the dry, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger, who seems pained by his ability to conjure cruelties like ''You could have been a legend/But you became a father.'' Baby Dayliner and Doveman open. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Lee Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) PSYCHIC ILLS, TELEPATHE, ELECTROPUTAS (Tomorrow) For any bands that play it, an advantage of droning, bad-trip, so-called experimental music is that it never goes out of style, because it has never been in style. These three New York bands reach back to Suicide, Joy Division and German groups like Can for their gray soundscapes, but with twists: Psychic Ills surrounds its guitars with warbling electronics; the two women of Telepathe make it spooky with Bjorkesque vocals and tribal percussion; and Electroputas goes for full disorientation. At 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) * RACHEL'S, CLOGS (Thursday) Attempts to bridge classical music with rock are often dry affairs that get neither right. But these two groups, gathered for the ''New Sounds Live'' series with John Schaefer of WNYC, draw exciting music from both sides of the divide in ways that make such distinctions seem silly. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20. (Sisario) RAINER MARIA (Tomorrow) For nearly a decade, this emo-ish trio could be counted on for big, urgent cries that sounded just a bit louder than the players were comfortable with. But on ''Catastrophe Keeps Us Together'' (Grunion), they have quieted down a bit, and in tender songs like ''Burn'' gained a new sense of control and expressiveness. With Ambulette. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario) * THE ROOTS (Tonight) This veteran hip-hop group from Philadelphia has stuck proudly to socially conscious, we're-all-in-this-together lyrics, but it is its excellence and flexibility as a live funk band that have made its reputation.

Tuesday offers the New Orleans pianist Henry Butler and Corey Harris, a blues guitarist who had a memorably wide-eyed meeting with the African master Ali Farka Touré in Martin Scorsese's ''Blues'' documentary. On Wednesday the group Ollabelle opens for the Del McCoury Band, the great bluegrass traditionalists who have recently been embraced by the jam-band world. The series closes on Thursday with the folk guitarist Chris Smither and the Campbell Brothers, joyful noisemakers of the sacred steel style, with gospel songs led by blazing slide guitar.

(Sisario) * TOM VERLAINE (Tonight) Tom Verlaine's pulsating, sensuous guitar playing in the 1970's band Television had a lasting effect on rock and postpunk, and in his solo work he has explored meditative improvisations. With Megan Reilly. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario) WALKMEN (Wednesday) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. The band's new album, ''A Hundred Miles Off'' (Record Collection), begins intriguingly, with festive Mexican horns, but pretty soon it's back to the familiar guitar-bleached anguish. With Mazarin and Nethers. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Midgette) * 'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow) The big news of the Met's revival of its 1991 production of Donizetti's ''Elixir of Love'' is the entrancing performance of Ruth Ann Swenson as Adina. Some opera buffs have long found Ms. Swenson's work vocally exquisite but temperamentally bland. Here she brings a breezy comic grace to the role of a wealthy young landowner in an Italian village who thinks herself immune to sentimental notions about love, until the painfully shy peasant Nemorino gets through to her. Ms. Swenson sings with her trademark creamy sound, effortful richness and impressive agility. The promising young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, in his debut season at the Met, sings Nemorino.

At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Allan Kozinn) EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) You could call Rameau a new old master: his work has been increasingly explored and performed in the last few decades. Early Music New York isn't the first group to present his opera and ballet suites this season -- Les Violins du Roy did it well in February, and Emmanuelle Haïm at Mostly Mozart last summer -- which just goes to show that the music is well worth hearing. At 8 p.m., St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) In an installment of its Hear and Now discussion series, the composer Steven Stucky explores Elliott Carter's Allegro Scorrevole with the conductor Ludovic Morlot.

At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 780-2181; $20 to $45. (Kozinn) DAVID RUSSELL (Sunday) Benjamin Britten's Cello Suites are extraordinary essays, modern equivalents of Bach's unaccompanied cello works. Like the Bach set, they are technically demanding and leave a cellist nowhere to hide, as David Russell will demonstrate in a promising traversal. At 4 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2390; $10; $5 for students and 65+.

(Rockwell) * ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' set to live music, begins with her six dancers struggling as if pushed and dragged by internal physical forces, and ends with dancers moving through a setting that includes a moveable staircase, a hallway to nowhere and a mysteriously illuminated corner. (Through May 28.) At 8:30 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561; $15. (Dunning) SITELINES: KEELY GARFIELD AND ZACH MORRIS (Thursday) The site-specific ''Hope and Anchor'' conjures up fleeting images of sailors, sirens and storms. (Through May 27 and June 1 through 3.) At 7 p.m., various locations, the South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free. (Anderson) TAP CITY YOUTH ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Dance lovers can watch tap dancing while they shop.

(Anderson) * CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Williams, a dancer and choreographer who has worked with the puppeteer Basil Twist, made the remarkable ''Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins'' at Performance Space 122. This new program offers more medievally inspired choreography: his ''Portuguese Suite'' and three solos from ''The Golden Legend,'' a male adjunct to the female ''Ursula,'' with John Kelly as one of the performers. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15.

(Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. (See above.) (Smith) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION' The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, through Sept. 18. (Smith) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) Galleries: SoHo 'EVA HESSE: DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through May 27. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Julia Condon: 'Mandalas' Inspired by Tibetan tradition, Ms. Condon uses many thin glazes on square canvases to create entrancing, soft-focus mandalas in which diaphanous crystalline and floral patterns radiate from glowing centers. Dinter Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 947-2818, through June 3. (Johnson) Justin Craun: 'The Individual' Inspired partly by kitschy Christian record album cover images from the 1950's, this inventive young painter creates acidic, vividly abstracted and patterned portraits of people who look as if they've been possessed by evil aliens from outer space. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through June 10. (Johnson) Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through next Friday. (Johnson) Ilya & Emilia Kabakov The painter, sculptor, storyteller and Conceptualist Mr. Kabakov and his partner, Emilia Kabakov, present a series of paintings they made recently, but that museum-style labels claim were made in the 1970's by Ilya Kabakov, who may or may not be the same person as the author of this exhibition. The paintings adroitly mix passages of Modernist abstraction and social realism, but the real interest is in the idea of the art history of an alternative universe. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through May 27. (Johnson) 'Never Mind the Bollocks: Here's Amanda Lear' Muse, film actress, professional Somebody, Amanda Lear is also a painter, as her oil portraits of Francis Bacon, Salvador Dalí and Leonardo da Vinci attest. But the point of the show is to pay homage to Ms. Lear herself, and some interesting artists: Scott Hug, Kanishka Raja, Ryan Steadman and James. J. Williams III, with paintings; Michelle Lopez and Anna Sew Hoy, with small sculptures; and -- best -- Christoph Broich with a large work of latex and lace titled ''The Girl Who Sold Her Soul to the Devil and Won.'' Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, sixth floor, (212) 242-7524, through June 3. (Cotter) * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson) Christoph Worringer In his large-scale allegories, this young German painter features multiple images of himself with pupil-less eyes in mysterious theatrical situations. Whatever they may mean, it is tantalizing to imagine where Mr. Worringer's blend of traditionalist figurative painting and Postmodernist surrealism might lead. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159, through June 10. (Johnson) Other Galleries Glen Fogel and Yoko Inoue Yoko Inoue, born in Japan, looks at what it is to be American in a solo show that includes a stack of woolen ''Old Glory'' sweaters made by weavers in South America, and a series of portraits of Ms. Inoue made by other artists. A new video by Glen Fogel, shot during the Billy Graham Crusade at Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 2005, focuses on the Christian rock bands that served as warm-up acts for Mr. Graham. The musicians look as if they could be from the 1960's, though the message they are delivering is very different. Or is it? Momenta, 72 Berry Street, near North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through June 12. (Cotter) 'Mystic River' The artist Noah Sheldon has assembled a lyrical group show not quite of this world. Dike Blair makes an unearthly thing of Las Vegas in a fine watercolor painting; the excellent Peter Coffin contributes a portrait in the form of a photographed aura; Martha Friedman offers a levitating rope; Ian Hundley displays a patch of aerial topography in the form of a crazy quilt; Roger White paints the sun. The spirit of Stephen Shore's 1970's photographs of the American landscape flows through it all. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through June 11. (Cotter) Last Chance Yto Barrada The French-Moroccan photographer Yto Barrada, recently seen in ''Snap Judgments'' at the International Center of Photography, makes a New York solo debut with this show. It includes excerpts from her documentation of the lives of North African immigrants legally barred from entry to Europe and passing time in the city of Tangier on the Strait of Gibraltar. Also on view is Ms. Barrada's wonderful video of a street magician in action. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' . During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885; closes today. (Johnson) * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking' This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Cotter) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled from American holdings covers the spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200; closes on Monday. (Glueck) 'Cady Noland Approximately' This Conceptual stunt of an exhibition presents 11 simulations of works by the influential and much admired sculptor Cady Noland, an artist known for carefully controlling where and when her works are exhibited. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * Aaron Parazette: 'All On Up' This Houston-based painter creates punchy, colorful, sign-like compositions, using big letters as his basic building blocks. The letters spell words like insane, juice and thruster, but they are variously inverted, reversed and mixed up to enhance the exceptionally gratifying graphic impact. Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212) 463-8634; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)",4fd2aec88eb7c8105d89d2ca,14908

Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 307-4100. 'INDIAN BLOOD' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 9. Primary Stages presents A. R.

LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Through July 30. This always-buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge (see below), and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500. MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL Through Aug. 6. The seventh annual showcase often gets lost in the shuffle, despite its large and diverse collection of shows. There should be more than 60 productions this season, at four locations on 36th Street. Schedules and information; (212) 868-4444. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) Off Off Broadway 'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to music by Earth, Wind & Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'MANHATTAN MADCAPS of 1924' A not-very-madcap story is indeed included, but this is essentially a revue made of up of Rodgers and Hart songs, many of them fairly obscure. Better singing voices in the cast might help show them off to fuller advantage; as it is, the main attraction is a trio of songs with unfamiliar lyrics, but a very familiar tune: the one that, on the fourth try, became ''Blue Moon'' (1:20). Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' José Rivera, who wrote the screenplay for ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday.(Jason Zinoman) 'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning, but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Stephen Holden) * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) 'EDMOND' (R, 76 minutes) William H. Macy gives what may be the performance of his career in the faithful screen adaptation of David Mamet's raw, epithet-spattered spiritual fable about a buttoned-up milquetoast who heeds his inner demons and plummets into free fall; hateful and unforgettable. (Holden) * 'EXCELLENT CADAVERS' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English and Italian) Based on the book by Alexander Stille, this tough, brisk documentary follows Mr. Stille to Italy, where he reconstructs the recent history of the Italian mafia, focusing on the careers of two courageous prosecutors who took on organized crime and the political system that protected it. (Scott) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) * 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis) 'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee) 'MINI'S FIRST TIME' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) 'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis) '71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This 1994 film from that great provocateur Michael Haneke follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters, all of whom -- perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance -- have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a student starts unloading his revolver. (Dargis) 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) 'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott) 'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis) Film Series GREAT VILLAINS IN CINEMA (Through July 30) BAMcinématek is honoring movie bad guys, from Dracula to Michael Corleone.

DICKEY BETTS AND GREAT SOUTHERN (Wednesday) Kicked out of the Allman Brothers, a band he founded, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. With Kenny Wayne Shepherd. At 9:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $52. (Jon Pareles) MARY J. BLIGE (Tonight) Mary J.

(Ben Sisario) * BRAND NEW (Thursday) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on the as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans, who quickly snatched up all tickets for this tour. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO, JESSE HARRIS, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Jesse Harris, who wrote Ms. Jones's hit ''Don't Know Why,'' sings in the graceful and guileless manner of Paul Simon and James Taylor when on his own. Mike Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. At 9 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sisario) * CAT POWER (Tuesday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded with a group of veteran Memphis soul players, yielding some of the most stirring -- and happiest -- music of her career. Performing solo, she is spellbindingly intense and mercurial. At 8 p.m., Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-4300; $20. (Sisario) CHEB I SABBAH (Tomorrow) Indian devotional music meets the beat, now and then, in the music of DJ Cheb I Sabbah, who swirls together various styles into heady meditations. He is joined on vocals by the singer Riffat Salamat Sultana, daughter of the Pakistani singer Ustad Salamat Ali Khan. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Pareles) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden) DON CABALLERO (Tonight) In the mid-1990's, Don Caballero, from Pittsburgh, was one of a handful of overachieving guitar bands whose knotty, laser-precise and deliberately undanceable instrumentals exemplified the fittingly named subgenre math-rock. The band broke up six years ago, but its drummer, Damon Che, has repopulated it with new players; its new album, ''World Class Listening Problem'' (Relapse), suggests that there was more to the old group's appeal than just math. With Blind Idiot God, Alger Hiss, Houston McCoy and the Victoria Lucas. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $13. (Sisario) 'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Thursday) Each summer Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, throws a festival with some big-deal reunions -- big deals in the small and passionate world of garage-rock, anyway. This year its three-day series begins on Thursday with the return of the Dicks, a Texas band from the early 1980's that sang ragged and churlish complaints with titles like ''Hate the Police.'' Also on the bill are the Marked Men, the Carbonas and Live Fast Die. The highlight of the festival will be an appearance by Rocket From the Tombs on July 29. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17. (Sisario) EARLY MAN, BAD WIZARD, 3 INCHES OF BLOOD (Tuesday) The best retro bands do not just conjure up an old artist or even a specific era, but freely toy with their influences to suggest a past that never quite existed. Three Inches of Blood updates the galloping, swords-and-goblins rock of early-1980's groups like Iron Maiden and Manowar with harsh streaks of violence that recall later death-metal. Early Man, on its debut album, ''Closing In'' (Matador), begins in the comforting mud of Black Sabbath and ends airborne, with a speed and control that comes down from Metallica. Also on the bill is Bad Wizard, whose plodding re-creations of Grand Funk Railroad and Kiss illustrate a less imaginative kind of retro-rock. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) MELISSA ETHERIDGE (Monday through Wednesday) Love takes on heroic dimensions in the songs of Melissa Etheridge. She puts her own mark on the brawny guitar riffs and raspy-voiced melodies of 1980's heartland rock, as adoring audiences sing along. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $104.50. (Pareles) GOLDEN SMOG (Wednesday) Even heartsick alt-country has its celebrity supergroups. Golden Smog includes Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, and Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run. Opening the show is David Poe, a singer and guitarist, whose wit and sparkle come through largely between songs. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) HOLD STEADY (Thursday) Like the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, though with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I heard about original sin,'' he growls. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario) JONATHAN KANE (Tomorrow) John Lee Hooker meets La Monte Young in the droning, bluesy incantations of Mr. Kane, a mainstay in the downtown avant-garde scene who has played drums with Swans, Rhys Chatham and Gary Lucas. He has a drummer's sense of steady dynamic development and an unapologetic love of noise. He plays two shows. At 2 p.m., with Dragons of Zynth, Home and Taiko Masala, East River Amphitheater, East River Park, south of Delancey Street, Lower East Side, ermp.org; free. At 9 p.m., with Golden Tongues, Mahi Mahi and Ambitious Orchestra, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Sisario) * JASON LYTLE (Tomorrow and Monday) In Grandaddy, Mr. Lytle sang as if he were Neil Young trapped inside a computer chip: with a voice tiny and yet infinite, yearning to be fully human yet stuck within the strictures of the information age. Grandaddy recently released its final album, ''Just Like the Fambly Cat'' (V2), but it is an unsatisfying epitaph; fans will crowd these rare solo shows for hints of a new direction. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Monday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario) MALDITA VECINDAD, KONONO NO. 1, DAARA J (Sunday) What do a ska-flavored Mexican hard-rock band, a Congolese group that makes trance music from amplified thumb pianos and a Senegalese rap trio have in common? Not much except that they can all be lumped into the world-music category, however puzzlingly. Maldita Vecindad paints its ska rhythms with ominous, distorted metal. Konono No. 1 titled one album ''Congotronics,'' an apt term for its polyrhythmic bubblings of amplified likembés -- hand-held thumb pianos made from thin strips of medal. Daara J speed-raps in at least four languages: English, French, Spanish and Wolof. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Maldita Vecindad also plays Sunday night at S.O.B.'s, and Konono No. 1 plays there on Monday.

(Sisario) THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED (Tuesday) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles) JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS (Tonight) In the 1960's John Mayall ran the premier finishing school for British blues-rock guitarists: at various times his band -- still called the Bluesbreakers despite 40-odd years of lineup changes -- included the young Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones) and Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac), among others. At 8 and 10:30, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sisario) OAKLEY HALL (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into dense psychedelic drones in the songs of this Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With Mike Wexler, Black Taj and Endless Boogie. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sisario) * OS MUTANTES (Tonight) The oddest, most exuberant and most wonderfully innovative band of the late-1960's tropicália movement in Brazil -- when there was no shortage of odd, exuberant and wonderfully innovative musicians -- was Os Mutantes (the Mutants), which filtered American and British psychedelic and garage-rock through bossa nova and a do-what-thou-wilt pop-art philosophy. The band broke up in 1978, and before this brief tour -- with some but not all of its original members -- had never performed in the United States. With Death Vessel. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $50. (Sisario) PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES, JASON LYTLE (Sunday) In the weeks before the concert giant Live Nation begins to put on big-ticket concerts at the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (its first there is Bloc Party on July 29), a number of smaller, scrappier promoters have been using the space -- a 50,000-square-foot public pool closed since 1984 -- for free shows. Sunday afternoon features Pretty Girls Make Graves, a Seattle band with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise; and Mr. Lytle, the lead singer of Grandaddy, who is in town this weekend for a few appearances (see above). With Bon Savants. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com. (Sisario) RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Pareles) BUTCH WALKER AND THE LET'S GO OUT TONITES (Wednesday) Mr. Walker first revealed his fondness for muscular mid-1970's pop-rock and his mocking obsession with stardom as the leader of the Marvelous 3. Now on his own, he hasn't lost his ambition or his sense of irony. With Boys Like Girls and As Fast As. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Pareles) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Monday) This little big band, led by the irrepressible slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, has a forthcoming album called ''MTO Volume 1'' (Sunnyside) that is full of signature touches, like effervescent swing arrangements and covers of hits by Prince and Stevie Wonder.

(Chinen) DON BYRON QUARTET (Wednesday through July 30) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist. He plays here with several longtime associates: the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Billy Hart. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 on July 28 and 29.

(Chinen) * CELEBRATION OF RAY BARRETTO & HILTON RUIZ (Tuesday through July 30) ''Standards Rican-ditioned,'' recently issued on Zoho Music, was the final studio album of the conga virtuoso Ray Barretto. It also turned out to be the last recorded effort by the pianist Hilton Ruiz. Both were New York-born musicians of Puerto Rican heritage and were pillars of Latin jazz. This tribute, fittingly programmed as the culmination of Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's monthlong Latin in Manhattan Festival, includes Mr. Barretto's son Chris Barretto, as well as a two more-established saxophonists, Sonny Fortune and David Sánchez. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set July 28 and 29, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen) ORRIN EVANS QUINTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Evans is a percussive pianist equally attuned to hard bop and hip-hop, and he often surrounds himself with rhythmically assertive sidemen.

(Chinen) FRED HERSCH TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Hersch, a pianist strongly associated with solo recitals, leads a trio for this outdoor performance, and not with his usual partners.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.

(Dunning) CHASHAMA OASIS FESTIVAL 2006 (Today and Sunday) Artists of all disciplines -- some, we suspect, wildly undisciplined in the grand tradition of Chashama productions -- will perform in a Midtown window and outdoors. Today from noon to 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 7 p.m., Chashama window performance, 217 East 42nd Street, between Second and Third Avenues, Manhattan.

(Dunning) DECADANCETHEATER (Thursday) This all-female hip-hop group from Brooklyn won plaudits for its reworking of Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' two years ago. Now its members are trying their hand at a 12th-century Japanese ghost story. But not to worry: there will be a live D.J. 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street; (212) 334-7479. Thursday benefit tickets begin at $50.(Roslyn Sulcas) HEIDI DUCKLER COLLAGE DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Duckler is known as Los Angeles's ''queen of site-specific performance,'' the press release says. This production of ''Laundromatinee,'' part of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Sitelines performances, may well show she deserves claim to the title. It involves dancers spinning in dryers and hanging from clotheslines, then -- this sounds like the best bit -- removing their clothes to sing ''Stand By Your Man.'' 8.30 p.m., Laundromat, 168 Elizabeth Street, between Spring and Kenmare Streets; (212) 219-9401, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free.

In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater, Nrityagram, a highly regarded Indian ensemble specializing in Odissi dance, plays through the weekend, and moving in on Thursday through next weekend is the Danish Dance Theater, billed as that country's leading modern-dance ensemble. Mr. Saarinen's company, tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m.; $50. Yerbabuena, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Shawn Theater, $50.

(Dunning) *NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Saturday, Sunday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of last winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, is winding down its two-month run at the intimate Theater 80, which will end July 30. Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45.(Rockwell) * PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow, Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects.

(Rockwell) 'RIVER DEEP: A TRIBUTE TO TINA TURNER' (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) Gabrielle Lansner pays tribute to Ms. Turner, who is played by Pat Hall, in a multimedia production set to music by Philip Hamilton. Through July 29. Tonight and Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200 or gabriellelansner.com; $35. (Dunning) SUMMER IN THE SQUARE (Wednesday) As part of the Union Square Park's outdoor performance series, Performance Space 122 will present excerpts from the coming season. Saar Harari, whose ''Herd of Bulls'' was enthusiastically received last fall, will perform a section from ''Moopim''; the Palissimo dance company will perform Pavel Zustiak's ''Le Petit Mort''; and Chris Yon will dance with Taryn Griggs in the mysteriously titled ''Elephant (Terrible) Assisted Suicide [in ought 6].'' 6 p.m., Union Square Park, East 14th to East 17th Street, Manhattan; free. (Sulcas) * 'TAP CITY 2006' (Tonight and tomorrow) This spirited summer festival suggests that camaraderie and a sense of community are not dead in tap dance, on stage and in the audience. It includes two programs. ''Tap and Song,'' a celebration of traditional vaudeville, comedy and classic song-and-dance, stars the irrepressible Tony Waag, the festival's founder and director. He will be joined by a generous roster of artists, including the veteran tapper Mable Lee, the German Tap and Tray duo, the chic two-woman Tapage and the hoedown tapper Nate Cooper. ''Tap Forward'' features familiar tap soloists, cutting-edge types and up-and-comers. ''Tap and Song'' is tonight at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; ''Tap Forward'' is tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street; (212) 239-6200 or www.atdf.org; $40. (Dunning) THOMAS-ORTIZ DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Ted Thomas and Frances Ortiz combine urban athleticism and Latin sensuality in choreographic explorations of socially relevant themes. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 924-0077; $15, $25. (Anderson) * CASSIE TERMAN AND SHINICHI MOMO KOGA (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Terman and Mr. Koga create a world full of humor and pathos out of empty space and perfectly attuned physical-theater skills. 8 p.m., Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, between 12th and 13th Streets, Manhattan; (212) 352-3101; $15. (Dunning) YOUNG DANCEMAKERS COMPANY (Thursday) These choreographers -- New York City high school students chosen by audition for a summer intensive in dance technique, performing and making dances -- know how to put on a very good show. It's free, too. Their tour of city sites continues through Aug. 3. Thursday at 2 p.m. Stern Auditorium, Mount Sinai Hospital, Fifth Avenue at 100th Street, Upper East Side; (718) 329-7250 or www.ecfs.org/ydc.asp; reservations required. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith) * FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MORGAN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM: 'MASTERWORKS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400. (Smith) NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN : CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700. (Johnson) * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson) * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith) * SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith) * RUDY BURCKHARDT: 'NEW YORK PAINTINGS' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson) GEORGE HERMS Starting out as a beatnik in the 1950's, Mr. Herms has been creating and exhibiting his richly poetic assemblages of grungy found materials in California, his home state, for more than a half century. This show's eight works, from 1965 to 2002, variously call to mind Ernst, Duchamp, Cornell and Rauschenberg, but they have as well their own spiritually generous, heartfelt mix of hermetic imagination and Whitman-esque populism. Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, through July 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box and the knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he found. Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Aug. 12. (Johnson) * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith) 'Material Abuse' Unconventional uses of nontraditional materials include Shinique Smith's massive bale of all-white clothing; Michael Arcega's fleet of 300 tiny, balsa-wood tanks; Richard Klein's assemblage made from 10 years' worth of blown-out light-bulb filaments; Jean Shin's stacks of prescription pill bottles; Ray Beldner's dust-covered assemblages made of ordinary objects stolen from other people; and a star-and-stripe-patterned bikini made of map tacks by Devorah Sperber. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, through Aug. 4. (Johnson) 'Money Changes Everything' A show of artworks made at least partly out of actual money: dollar bills, mostly, but Iraqi dinar notes, too. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722, through July 28. (Johnson) 'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Aug. 19. (Johnson) * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter) Last Chance * THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, closes today. (Smith)",4fd253088eb7c8105d7f8edf,14327

Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750. 'PIG FARM' Opens on Tuesday.

Two parents, a pair of artists, re-examine their seven-year-old relationship after the accidental death of their child in this play by Orran Farmer, directed by Chris Chaberski (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much; the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates) 'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) 'ELVIS AND JULIET' This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444.(Gates) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Gates) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AMERICANA ABSURDUM and THE COMPLETE LOST WORKS OF SAMUEL BECKETT ' 'The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett ' consists of affectionate and hilarious short spoofs of Beckett's spare, rigorous and brooding dramas, as well as tedious segues involving mock threats of legal action against the spoofers. 'Americana Absurdum' is an interestingly glib, deeply cynical satire of stereotypical American greed, rapaciousness and narcissism whose serious purposes are unfortunately clouded by a production invested much more in style than in sense (1:45). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Monday. (Hunka) * 'AWAKE AND SING!' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2006) Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter putdowns clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'IN THE MATTER OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER' In the title role, Thomas Jay Ryan makes morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. This is a long but frequently gripping play of literate talk and real ideas (2:45). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Tuesday. (Gates) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) * 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicho las Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'bombon-EL PERRO' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Spanish) A lonely, unemployed, middle-aged man finds a glimmer of hope when he acquires a purebred show dog in this sweet, gritty neo-realist fable from Argentina. (Scott) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Stephen Holden) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden) 'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series INDIEWIRE: UNDISCOVERED GEMS (Tuesday and Wednesday) This eight-month-long series presents film-festival features that have not found theatrical distributors. This month's movie is Arin Crumley and Susan Buice's ''Four Eyed Monsters,'' about a couple who take a new approach to romantic interactivity and truly become one person. Cinema Village, 12th Street between University Place and Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Anita Gates) STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series continues this weekend with ''Lolita'' (1962), in which James Mason plays Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, romancing an adolescent girl, and ''Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1963), Kubrick's nuclear-weapons comedy starring Peter Sellers. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Kagemusha'' (1980), starring Tatsuya Nakadai as a small-time thief hired to impersonate a medieval warlord. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) NEW YORK ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through July 1) Subway Cinema's fifth annual festival of high-grossing and/or award-winning new movies continues at Anthology Film Archives. The weekend's films, all from 2005, include ''The Great Yokai War,'' which has been described as Takashi Miike's ''Lord of the Rings''; ''Cromartie High School,'' a Japanese spoof of juvenile delinquent movies; and ''Linda Linda Linda,'' about Japanese high school girls (and one Korean) who form a band. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, and ImaginAsian Theater, 239 East 59th Street, (212) 371-6682; $9. (Gates) NORDIC NOIR: CRIME DRAMAS FROM SWEDEN AND DENMARK (Through Aug. 10) The American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ''Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries,'' television films written by Mr. Mankell, the author of the internationally best-selling Wallander novels. In Wednesday's film, ''The African,'' a black man's body is found on a train that originated in Wallander's Swedish hometown. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art's three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts continues. This weekend's features include William Jones's ''Massillon'' (1991), a gay road movie, and ''Tony Oursler: Pioneering Videos,'' which includes ''Life of Phillis'' (1979), Mr. Oursler's psychosexual soap opera. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through Thursday) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni nears its end with three films this weekend. ''Zabriskie Point'' (1970) is his view of the American 1960's counterculture, complete with campus riots. ''L'Éclisse'' (1962) is a love story with angst, starring Monica Vitti and Alain Delon. ''Red Desert'' (1964) also stars Ms. Vitti, this time as a mentally ill housewife. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFI (Tonight) AFI gives its slithery, death-and-gloom-obsessed songs a jolt of fierce energy by reaching back to the anthemic hard-core punk of 1980's groups like Agnostic Front (as well as to 90's pop-punkers like Green Day). The recipe works: last week, on the strength of its catchy single ''Miss Murder,'' the band's new album, ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), went to No. 1. Also on the bill are Dillinger Escape Plan, which plays an impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz, and Nightmare of You. At 6:45, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Ben Sisario) ALLMAN BROTHERS, DEREK TRUCKS BAND (Tuesday) Derek Trucks, who is starting to take on a role similar to the young Eric Clapton's -- that of a phenomenally gifted, graceful blues-rock guitarist whose presence makes anything better -- does double duty here, playing with the Southern-rock granddaddies the Allman Brothers and also opening the show with his own group. At 7 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; $20 to $65. (Sisario) ATMOSPHERE (Monday) Atmosphere is a Minneapolis-based hip-hop group led by Slug, whose keenly written rhymes convey a gloomy sensibility more commonly associated with underground rock. With Brother Ali and Los Nativos. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Kelefa Sanneh) BLUE CHEER (Tonight) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960's and early 70's, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the band sound like cavemen discovering fire. With Soldiers of Fortune and Titan. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $15. (Sisario) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tuesday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place long. With Gold Streets and Adam Deitch Project. Pier 54, Hudson River at 13th Street; free. (Jon Pareles) CALEXICO (Tuesday) This collective from Tucson, centered on the guitarist and singer Joey Burns and the drummer John Convertino, elegantly mingles dry alt-country with surf guitar, mariachi and a folk-flavored psychedelia like that of the 1960's band Love. With Jason Collett, a sometime member of the Toronto indie collective Broken Social Scene, who draws inspiration from Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers, among others. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario) DEVOTCHKA (Tomorrow) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays a lot of moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. The band has a new mini-album with versions of Velvet Underground and Frank Sinatra songs, and recorded the score to a film at Sundance this year. With Norfolk & Western and the Mendoza Line. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sisario) ESPERS, BRIGHTBLACK MORNING LIGHT (Tonight) These two bands are part of a new wave that aims to revive the sound and the utopianism of 1960's folk. Espers, a mostly acoustic sextet from Philadelphia, plays airy English folk à la Fairport Convention, sometimes surrounding it with a foreboding drone. Brightblack Morning Light's sound is more intriguing because it's harder to place: an electric hum; warbling keyboards that evoke funk; and ecstatic, breathy chants. The songs on its new, self-titled album on Matador were written, the band has said, while living in tents in Northern California. With Mariee Souix. At 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) FEIST, JASON COLLETT, BUCK 65 (Sunday) Central Park SummerStage's annual Canada Day concert (well, close enough: the holiday is actually July 1) includes two singers whose indie-rock bona fides includes time with the great Toronto collective Broken Social Scene. Leslie Feist, a k a Feist, is a cosmopolitan chanteuse who knows how to rock a club, playing bossa nova, folk, Françoise Hardy bonbons and her specialty, the sad disco ballad; Jason Collett draws inspiration from a narrower field, including Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers. Also on the bill is Buck 65, a raspy rapper from Nova Scotia who rhymes about the backwoods life. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) FIERY FURNACES (Thursday) In a smart scramble of eras and attitudes, the Fiery Furnaces back flippantly surreal lyrics with blues riffs, teetering analog synthesizers, parlor piano and punky noise, coming up with a 21st-century urban skiffle. With Man Man and Standing Nudes. At 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Pareles) DIAMANDA GALÁS (Wednesday and Thursday) There are no small emotions for Diamanda Galás, whose compositions are music theater with its rawest nerves exposed. She takes up fear and rage, mourning and vengeance; her voice can reach operatic heights or slice through a room with primal moans and shrieks and sobs. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Pareles) * JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Thursday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. José González, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere guitar confessions with precision picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) I-THREES (Tomorrow) The I-Threes were the great reggae backup singers of the 1970's, formed to support Bob Marley and the Wailers. The members -- Rita Marley, Bob Marley's widow; Judy Mowatt, who was already a pop star in Jamaica when the group was founded; and Marcia Griffiths -- play a rare group date at the Apollo Theater. Also on the bill is Thandiswa, a singer in the trailblazing South African kwaito group Bongo Maffin, who on her new solo album, ''Zabalaza'' (Escondida), mingles traditional xhosa rhythms with hip-hop, gospel and reggae. At 8 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $45 to $55. (Sisario) JOE JACKSON (Thursday) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario) * JAY-Z (Sunday) Three years ago Jay-Z, the rap prince turned record executive, announced his retirement from performing, but he keeps finding ways to stay in the game: albums with R. Kelly and Linkin Park, some guest spots, a big radio-sponsored concert or two. Here he shows that he does not need any ruse but himself. He celebrates the 10th anniversary of his debut album, ''Reasonable Doubt,'' by performing it beginning to end. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) KEANE (Tonight) This British band consists of just a drummer, a singer and an awfully hard-working keyboardist, but manages to flesh out songs of yearning and self-pity with rich sonorities and sharp hooks that make you swear that there's a guitar in there somewhere. Keane has headlined Radio City Music Hall, but plays this much smaller show to promote its lush and mawkish new album, ''Under the Iron Sea'' (Island). At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) ARTHUR LEE BENEFIT (Tonight) In Los Angeles in the mid-1960's, the band Love, led by Arthur Lee, perfected a distinctly lyrical variety of psychedelia steeped in folk and garage-rock. Now 61, Mr. Lee is suffering from leukemia, and the roster of musicians at this benefit concert reveals some of his wide influence: Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Ryan Adams, Nils Lofgren, Yo La Tengo, Garland Jeffreys and Flashy Python and the Body Snatchers, a new group featuring Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $128.50. (Sisario) LIARS (Tomorrow and Monday) The Liars are an avant-garde rock band the way all avant-garde rock bands should be: noisy, challenging and unpredictable. It began playing cold, paranoid punk-funk and has gradually moved into ever eerier and more disorienting territory, as if trying to eliminate any trace of conventional rock 'n' roll from its sound. Tomorrow the band plays with one of its stylistic ancestors, Alan Vega of the great 1970's noise-punk minimalists Suicide; tomorrow and Monday's shows also include the Apes, a chaos-loving band from Washington that always keeps one yeti-like foot in Black Sabbath stomps. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; Monday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. Each show is $15 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario) NATALIE MacMASTER AND FRIENDS (Tonight) Ms. MacMaster, a fiddler whose repertory leans from Celtic music into bluegrass, leads a small group of musicians in a celebration of the Celtic music of her homeland, the Eastern Canadian island of Cape Breton. She performs with the powerful Irish-American Susan McKeown, the fiddler Donnell Leahy (who is also Ms. MacMaster's husband), the cellist Natalie Haas and the singer Catherine Russell. At 7:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) * MADONNA (Wednesday and Thursday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50. (Sisario) AUDRA McDONALD (Thursday) Ms. McDonald sings Broadway fare with a 33-piece orchestra; her program is likely to include what she calls songs associated with the ''two Barbaras,'' Cook and Streisand. With the gospel singer Liz McComb. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) TIM McGRAW AND FAITH HILL (Tonight and tomorrow night) The first couple of country-pop flash have recently acquired a slight and unexpected political edge -- though not much controversy -- by criticizing the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $99.50. (Sisario) ONE RING ZERO, LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE, SLAVIC SOUL PARTY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Barbès, a cozy bar and cabaret in Park Slope, serves as an incubator for a group of smart and casually eclectic musicians, the type who might mingle a little Gypsy music with their norteño. Now the club has started a record label to extend its support (and brand name), and offers a showcase this weekend. One Ring Zero, tonight at 9, has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. Las Rubias del Norte, at 10:30, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. Slavic Soul Party, tomorrow night at 10, plays a raucous mix of Eastern European music, funk and jazz. Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $8 suggested donation. (Sisario) PANIC! AT THE DISCO, DRESDEN DOLLS (Wednesday and Thursday) Panic! at the Disco, from Las Vegas, were discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who quickly signed the band to his own label, Decaydence. It's not hard to see why: the group has the slick runway look of the Killers (also from Las Vegas); the muscular, gushy emo-rock sound of Fall Out Boy; and a knack for song titles that could be Oscar Wilde epigrams, like ''The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage'' and ''Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off.'' The Dresden Dolls play elaborate, gender-bending cabaret-punk vamps and dress the part. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) * REFUGEE ALL STARS OF SIERRA LEONE (Tonight) These six musicians, ranging from a teenage rapper to a guitarist in his 50's, fled civil war in their homeland for a refugee camp in rural Guinea. They formed a band there four years ago, and tell their stories in songs tinged with soul and reggae. A documentary about the group, made by Zach Niles and Banker White, will be shown after its performance. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) * BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) A hootenanny of musicians, playing banjos, accordions, fiddles and guitars, accompanies Bruce Springsteen in folk songs of work, hardscrabble survival and political anger -- the Depression-era ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live'' gets a Hurricane Katrina rewrite -- from his latest album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' (Columbia). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; $46.25 to $91.75. (Sisario) * THE STREETS, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tuesday) The best and weirdest of new British hip-hop: the Streets, a k a Mike Skinner, is a loquacious rapper whose monotonous delivery can sometimes make him sound like a robot learning to rhyme, and Lady Sovereign, a k a Louise Harman, is a teenage firecracker who is one of the most entertaining exponents of grime, a hyperactive rap-plus-techno British subgenre. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden) * JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style, is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at all 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows tonight and tomorrow night. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. TIM BERNE DUOS (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Berne, an adventurous alto saxophonist, has always had some of his strongest musical connections with drummers. Next week he goes head to head with two of them: the suggestive and fluid Gerald Cleaver (Wednesday) and the wry, responsive Tom Rainey (Thursday). On Wednesday at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. On Thursday at 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen) ANDY BEY (Wednesday through July 1) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll surely demonstrate here. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BRAZIL NIGHTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The superb guitarist Romero Lubambo leads two Brazilian jazz acts this weekend, and neither should be missed. Tonight it's Trio da Paz, with the bassist Nilson Matta and the drummer Duduka da Fonseca; the pianist Kenny Barron will join them as a special guest. Tomorrow the setting will be more intimate: just Mr. Lubambo and the singer Luciana Souza, as on her ''Brazilian Duos'' albums. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) JIM BLACK'S ALAS NO AXIS (Sunday) Noise rock, along with numerous strains of music made on laptops, exerts a heavy influence on Mr. Black's music, as his new album, ''Dogs of Great Indifference'' (Winter & Winter), confirms. But tuneful lyricism and jazz improvisation also have a place in his working band, which features his drums and electronics, on the same plane as Chris Speed's tenor saxophone and clarinet, Skuli Sverrisson's electric bass and Hilmar Jensson's guitar. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen) * A SALUTE TO CACHAO: MASTER OF THE MAMBO (Tomorrow) In the 1940's Israel Lopez, known as Cachao, helped define modern Cuban music; he is the most influential Latin bassist of all time, and one of Cuban music's most important bandleaders. His signature descargas will serve as the common language of this tribute, which is well stocked with artists like the conga drummer Carlos Valdez, the trumpeter Alfredo Armenteros, the flutist Dave Valentin and the trombonist Jimmy Bosch. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) BILLY CHILDS JAZZ-CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) Mr. Childs, an accomplished pianist, composer and producer, favors a billowy sound in his own music, which sometimes drifts perilously close to New Age. But beneath a genteel atmosphere of piano, saxophone, harp, guitar and strings lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Brian Blade on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. (Chinen) AVISHAI COHEN BAND (Sunday) Mr. Cohen is an assertive trumpeter with a taste for modernism, and he keeps good company here: the alto saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the guitarist Lionel Loueke, the pianist Jason Lindner, the bassist Omer Avital and the drummer Daniel Freedman. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) JOHN COWHERD, JOHN PATITUCCI, BRIAN BLADE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Blade, the lithe and subtle drummer, serves as the fulcrum of this impressionistic trio, which features two of his frequent collaborators. Mr. Cowherd plays piano and writes music for Mr. Blade's Fellowship band, while Mr. Patitucci, the bassist, plays with Mr. Blade in the working band led by the saxophonist Wayne Shorter. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, near Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $20. (Chinen) DAVE DOUGLAS GROUP (Sunday) Mr. Douglas, the trumpeter and composer, taps an aggressive improvisational vein with this assembled quartet, which features the august Henry Grimes and Andrew Cyrille on bass and drums. J. D. Allen, a probing tenor saxophonist, rounds out the ensemble. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) JAMES FINN'S NDA NANAA (Thursday) On his recent album, ''Plaza de Toros'' (Clean Feed), the tenor saxophonist James Finn teased out a connection between bullfighting and free jazz, with appropriate doses of bravado and humor. Here he steps into the ring with the trombonist Steve Swell, the pianist Gordon Beeferman and the percussionist Jackson Krall. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) BILL FRISELL TRIO/PETRA HADEN AND KELLY JOE PHELPS (Tonight) Rustic Americana is the prevailing atmosphere of this concert, thanks to Mr. Frisell, one of jazz's most imaginative guitarists, and to the duo of Ms. Haden, a singer, and Mr. Phelps, a guitarist and singer-songwriter. Given the overlapping histories onstage -- Mr. Frisell has recorded with both of his fellow headliners -- it should be a freewheeling evening. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, www.symphonyspace.org; $23 and $28. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Through Sunday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ -- like the saxophonists James Moody, Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath -- as well as Roy Hargrove, the trumpeter enlisted here to fill his shoes.

At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, www.celebratebrooklyn.org; free. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) HAPPY APPLE (Sunday) This Minneapolis-based trio fashions a hardy yet elastic amalgam of indie-rock and post-bop, with doses of sardonic humor. Its sound is served equally by Michael Lewis's saxophones, Erik Fratzke's electric bass and David King's drums. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $12, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) * HERBIE'S WORLD: HERBIE HANCOCK AND FRIENDS (Tonight) Mr. Hancock is one of jazz's most successful chameleons, in addition to being one of its finest pianists. This impressive concert gives him the opportunity to dig into fluid pianism (in duets with Gonzalo Rubalcaba); ambitiously abstract chamber improvisation (in a quartet with the tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Brian Blade); earthy rhythm section work (in a trio with the bassist Ron Carter and the drummer Jack DeJohnette); and deep-rooted groove (in a band with the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the bassists Matt Garrison and Marcus Miller, among others). At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 to $100. JVC Jazz Festival.

(Chinen) * PAUL MOTIAN BAND (Tuesday through July 2) This luminous ensemble consists of two contrasting pairs of improvisers (the tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Cheek, and the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Ben Monder); a couple of stabilizers (Jacob Bro and Jerome Harris, also guitarists); a lone anchor (the bassist Ben Street); and a mastermind (Mr. Motian, on drums). The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Friday and Saturday, with a $10 minimum.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) BILL STEWART TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Though he is known primarily as a sideman, Mr. Stewart, a drummer, has a composer's vocabulary, as he proved with a pair of underrated Blue Note albums in the 1990's. He connects here with Larry Goldings on Hammond B-3 organ and Kevin Hayes on piano, mining a post-bop sound that owes more than a little to rhythm and blues. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen) BUSTER WILLIAMS AND SOMETHING MORE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Williams's bass playing is the anchor but not the focal point of this chamber-jazz quintet, with his longtime rhythm-section partner Lenny White on drums; Marcus Strickland on tenor and soprano saxophone; Stefon Harris on vibraphone; and on piano either George Colligan (tonight) or Anthony Wonsey (tomorrow). At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Anne Midgette) 'GLORY DENIED' (Monday) The invaluable Center for Contemporary Opera, which helps living composers place their operas, either completed or in-progress works, before the public, presents a staged reading of Tom Cipullo's ''Glory Denied.'' This Vietnam-era story is based on an oral history by the journalist Tom Philpott about Col. Jim Thompson, America's longest-held prisoner of war. When Act I was presented in 2004 as part of the New York City Opera's Vox readings, Mr. Cipullo's unsentimental handling of the story was complemented by his hard-edged, neo-Romantic musical style. Though this staged reading will present the complete opera, the cast will be accompanied only by piano. At 8 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $20.

As in past years, music is an important component of this summer's festival, which ends this weekend.

On Sunday afternoon the festival continues with a recital by the 12-year-old pianist and composer Drew Petersen; in the evening the director Daniel Anker will introduce his rather turgid film about the musicians of the Philadelphia Orchestra, ''Music From the Inside Out.''

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * METropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710.(Kimmelman) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11 This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed a golden opportunity to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed. (One gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer.) The 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 7. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by a young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design, and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles, related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly off-hand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through July 1. (Johnson) * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, through June 30. (Smith) Last Chance * 'Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited' Satiric and subversive Pop and Conceptualist works by more than 50 artists working in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the end of Communism. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Loretta Lux By means of subtle digital manipulations, Ms. Lux turns color photographs of children in empty rooms into hallucinatory portraits of angelic beings with slightly oversized heads; big, soulful eyes; and beautiful clothes. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * 'The Rest is Silence: James Lee Byars' New York only really started to wake up to James Lee Byars (1932-1997) when he died. This three-gallery survey has some early work but focuses on the large-scale sculptures of his later years. It is tempting to fit him into existing slots: performance art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, whatever. But his extravagance and his privacy combine to keep him outside the fold, as do his philosophical concerns: Big Ideas, or rather Big Questions, about perfection, death and eternity. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 526 West 24th Street, (212) 627-8000; 534 West 24th Street and 527 West 23rd Street; Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street and 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929); Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623. All close tomorrow.(Cotter)",4fd2517c8eb7c8105d7f5e8c,14921

Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street; (212) 307-4100. 'INDIAN BLOOD' In previews; opens Aug. 9. Primary Stages presents A. R. Gurney's new comedy about a rebellious boy coming of age in the 1940's. Mark Lamos directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200.

MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL Through Aug. 6. The seventh annual showcase may get lost in the shuffle, despite its large and diverse collection of shows. There should be more than 60 productions this season, at four locations on 36th Street. Schedules and information: (212) 868-4444. 'A STONE CARVER' An elderly carver refuses to make way for a new highway in this drama set in the 1970's. Dan Lauria (''The Wonder Years'') stars (1:40). Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village; (212) 691-1555. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BULLY' William Walsh plays the quotable Theodore Roosevelt in this interesting but not completely polished one-man show (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Off Off Broadway 'ANGEL MOUNTAIN' A young soldier, his mentally slow brother and their widowed father react to the new housekeeper in John-Richard Thompson's absorbing if sometimes predictable drama, set in 1946 (1:05). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching and beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'CLOUD TECTONICS' A solid rendition of Jose Rivera's thin fable about time, centering on a hitchhiking woman who has been pregnant for two years. Luis Vega is particularly good as the man who gives her a ride and shelter for the night (1:30). Culture Project-45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE AND OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where conmen are king (see ''The Producers.'') Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James at the mismatched swindlers. (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'FRANKENSTEIN, THE MUSICAL' More is not better in Robert Mitchell's show based on Mary Shelley's novel. The too many songs and scenes are confusing and ultimately defeat the cast, while Brian Charles Rooney as the scientist Victor Frankenstein might regain his fire if he switched roles with Timothy Warmen, who, as the lab mistake, seems more like a morose personal trainer out on a hike (2:15). The Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, between Washington and Greenwich Streets, West Village, (212) 627-2961; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ORANGE LEMON EGG CANARY' Rinne Groff's deceptive romance about a hard-drinking magician is like a great trick with a bungled payoff (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman) 'SECRETS' A clunky relationship drama about shrill, cruel middle-age couples (1:05). The Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closing on Sunday. (Hunka) 'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, just west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE' (No rating, 80 minutes) This admiring documentary portrait of the Silver Belles, an indefatigable troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical footnote and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. (Stephen Holden) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden) 'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis) 'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis) 'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldy creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee) 'Mini's First Time' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis) * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott) * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband, and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises, yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee) 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott) 'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden) 'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis) 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott) 'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) 'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis) 'THE WORLD ACCORDING TO SHORTS' (No rating, 95 minutes total running time) For audiences exhausted by today's bloated extravaganzas, ''The World According to Shorts'' is an eclectic palate cleanser. Addressing topics as diverse as aging, marital sex and the fantasy lives of children, this six-film sampling of world cinema ranges from the traditional to the surreal, the latter brilliantly exemplified by the German animated western ''Ring of Fire.'' As frustrated cowboys trail beckoning women and pulsing vaginas across a Dalíesque landscape, the wonderful world of Disney seems a million miles away. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis) Film Series FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Aug. 20) A 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962) continues at the Museum of the Moving Image with two silents starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. Borzage won the first-ever best-director Oscar for ''Seventh Heaven'' (1927), a love story set in a slum. In ''Street Angel'' (1928), Gaynor plays a Neapolitan prostitute. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) GREAT VILLAINS IN CINEMA (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's tribute to movie bad guys comes to a close this weekend with three films. In ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962), Angela Lansbury's character sells out her nearest and dearest for political power. In ''The Godfather: Part II'' (1974), Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) turns ruthless. In ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' (1979), Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz embraces the horror. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FESTIVAL: THROUGH AFRICAN EYES AND PRIZED PIECES (Through Thursday) This fifth annual outdoor festival concludes next week with two very different features. Wednesday night's film, from Senegal, is ''Hyenas'' (1992), a drama in which a rich woman bribes poor villagers to commit murder. Thursday night's feature is ''All on a Mardi Gras Day'' (2003), Royce Osborne's look at the history of African-American culture in New Orleans. Harlem Meer, Central Park, 110th Street and Lenox Avenue, (212) 352-1720; free. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues Sunday and Tuesday with ''The Lower Depths'' (1957), his adaptation of Maxim Gorky's masterpiece about poor souls in a flophouse. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) RAISING HELL: SAM PECKINPAH (Through Aug. 29) BAMcinématek's monthlong tribute to Peckinpah (1925-84) begins Tuesday night with ''Ride the High Country'' (1962), his second film, which stars Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea as Old West lawmen in a changing world. Thursday night's film is Peckinpah's masterpiece, ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969), a violent western about the nature of morality. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ADOLESCENTS (Sunday) After a painfully drawn-out dispute with its landlord, CBGB will close at the end of October, which means that everybody is rushing to play his last gig there. Sunday features the Adolescents, one of the architects of the early-1980's Southern California hardcore punk sound, who joined the scruffy melodicism of the Ramones with boys-will-be-boys petulance and angry social realism. With the Freeze, Street Dogs and the Vacancies. At 6:30 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario) BLOC PARTY (Tomorrow) With spiky but melodic guitars and agitated dance beats, Bloc Party revives the nervous funk of postpunk bands like Gang of Four. With Secret Machines and Mew. At 6:30 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $34. (Sisario) BON JOVI (Tomorrow) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album ''New Jersey,'' is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 1970's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn't hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $37.50 to $125. (Jon Pareles) * BRAND NEW (Tonight) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on its as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans. With Colour Revolt. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) EDIE BRICKELL AND NEW BOHEMIANS (Tonight) Sixteen years after her last studio album with New Bohemians, Edie Brickell has reunited with the group; their new record, ''Stranger Things'' (Fantasy/Concord), was released on Tuesday. With Sonya Kitchell, a teenage singer-songwriter whose debut CD is promoted by Starbucks. At 7, Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Mr. Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. Also on the bill are Grainne Ryan, Alice Bierhorst, Jim Boggia and the Jason Crigler Band. At 6 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. (Sisario) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden) DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN (Wednesday) With harsh screams and convoluted guitar riffs that sometimes seem to have been written with the aid of advanced calculus, this New Jersey band plays a cathartic and yet impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz. With God Forbid. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario) * DIXIE CHICKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) After first backing down slightly from their criticism of President Bush in 2003, the Dixie Chicks returned this year with ''Taking the Long Way'' (Columbia), a reflective and defiant album that declares: ''I'm not ready to make nice/I'm not ready to back down.'' Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $39.59 to $89.50. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $39.50 to $75. (Sisario) * 'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Tonight and tomorrow) For its minifestival each summer, Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, presents some big-deal reunions. This year features Rocket From the Tombs, a storied protopunk band from Cleveland that never recorded an album but spawned two influential groups when it broke up in 1975: the arty Pere Ubu and the more conventionally bratty Dead Boys. The band first reunited in 2003 and returns tomorrow with new material on a bill with the Little Killers, DC Snipers, Angry Angles and Imaginary Icons. Tonight's show features the Cynics, the Original Sins, the Hentchmen, the Turpentine Brothers and the Alarm Clocks, a 1960's band from Ohio whose single ''No Reason to Complain'' has been covered by countless shaggy-haired bands. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $17 tonight, $20 tomorrow. Rocket From the Tombs also plays on Sunday at 9 p.m. at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. (Sisario) NICOLAI DUNGER (Tonight) A Swedish balladeer with serious Van Morrison envy, Mr. Dunger makes earnest entreaties for romance and existential relief (''Take away my sadness, wipe away these blues in here'') in a tremulous tenor. With Elvis Perkins and Benjy Ferree. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario) EDITORS (Tonight) This band from Birmingham, England, chose a fitting name: it stitches together material from other sources with taste and artistry, joining the baritone-of-gloom vocals of Joy Division (''Oh, if fortune favors the brave/I am as poor as they come'') and the early U2's shimmering sheets of guitar. With Lake Trout and the Big Sleep. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) MARY GAUTHIER (Wednesday) Ms. Gauthier, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., and worked as a restaurateur before turning to music, writes sparse observations that suggest a modest but penetrating wisdom (''Every living thing could use a little mercy now''). With Eliza Gilkyson. At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue at 24th Street, (212) 538-6667; free. (Sisario) METERS (Thursday) Hurricane Katrina could not drown New Orleans syncopation. It lives on with the reunion of the Meters, the definitive New Orleans funk band since 1967. The group has backed others, but saved its snappiest, trickiest grooves for its own tracks. With Art Neville on keyboards, George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums, they open up nooks and crannies of the beat to carry every hip into irresistible motion. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $45. (Pareles) * NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, CALEXICO, FRAMES (Thursday) If the weather holds, this benefit for Central Park SummerStage will be a perfect night of smart, tuneful indie rock. The New Pornographers, from Vancouver, British Columbia, play sharp, elegant pop-rock with a wit that comes down from the Kinks. Calexico, a collective from Tucson, pushes desert-dry alt-country toward surf guitar, mariachi and a folk-flavored psychedelia like that of the 1960's band Love. The Frames are one of the most expressive Irish groups since U2. At 6 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the site. (Sisario) OLLABELLE (Monday through Thursday) Celebrating a new album, ''Riverside Battle Songs'' (Verve Forecast), Ollabelle, a vocal sextet that worships country, bluegrass and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, will play for four nights at Banjo Jim's, an East Village club the group has played many times. At 9 p.m., Avenue C at Ninth Street, (212) 777-0869, banjojims.com; $10. (Sisario) OZZFEST (Tomorrow) In its 11th installment, the annual carnival of black cotton T-shirts, guttural heavy metal and nostalgic affection for Ozzy Osbourne features System of a Down, Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold, Hatebreed, Lacuna Coil, Dragonforce and many others on a smaller stage. Ozzy fans in New York are fortunate: this concert is one of only 8 among the 27 stops on the tour that will feature Mr. Osbourne performing on the main stage. Doors open at 9 a.m., Randalls Island, near Icahn Stadium, 1 Randalls Island, (212) 307-7171, ozzfest.com; $87.50. (Sisario) BRAD PAISLEY (Tonight) A young songwriter who knows the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of those rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. With Eric Church, a rising country singer from North Carolina. At 8, Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, Bethel, N.Y., (845) 454-3388, bethelwoods.us; $46; $30.50 for lawn seats. (Sisario) * 'RAMAKIEN: A RAK OPERA' (Tonight through Sunday) The Lincoln Center Festival presents an intriguing ''rock-theater piece'' based on an excerpt from the Ramakien, the Thai national epic. The show features many of Thailand's biggest and most respected rockers, including Sek Loso, who has led his band at the South by Southwest and Glastonbury festivals; the Photo Sticker Machine, an electronic group; and Rik Vachilapun, called a cross between Diamanda Galás and Patti Smith. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $40. (Sisario) The RED KRAYOLA (Wednesday) The first album of the Red Crayola (as it was originally called) appeared in 1967, and Mayo Thompson has held on to its skewed psychedelic perspective ever since; he also spent some years as a member of Pere Ubu. He's fond of dissolving song structures, crypto-Marxist messages and woozy sounds, and when he reconvened the Red Krayola (its name was changed to avoid trademark problems) in 1994, he found fans and collaborators among progressive- and post-rock musicians. With White Magic and Miighty Flashlight. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles) * SLEATER-KINNEY (Wednesday) After a 12-year reign over indie rock, the three women of Sleater-Kinney are calling it quits: their brief summer tour will find them screaming their last shrill screams and playing their last postpunk deconstructions of thick, meaty guitar riffs. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) SOUL ASYLUM (Thursday) This Minneapolis band lived the story of alternative rock: from loud and scrappy beginnings in the early 1980's, it matured largely out of sight of the mainstream, then found sudden fame in the 90's. The next phase is the reunion with something to prove, and on ''The Silver Lining'' (Legacy), its first new studio album in eight years, Soul Asylum proves that it still has a strong command of burly guitar and yearning vocals.

(Sisario) DAR WILLIAMS (Wednesday) In bare and tuneful songs that are called folk because they are quiet but could very well be rock, Ms. Williams is sometimes reflective and sometimes topical, as in her recent ''Teen for God,'' which explores religion as a psychological terror on the young: ''Dear Lord, I plan each day/The things I will not do or say.'' She plays an acoustic set. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $50, including museum admission.

DON BYRON QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist.

(John Rockwell) * JPMORGAN CHASE LATINO CULTURAL FESTIVAL: GRUPO KRAPP (Wednesday and Thursday) This earthy, funny dance and theater troupe from Argentina will present its new ''Project E,'' a festival commission, in which tall, beautiful performers wander out of their dance and find themselves shrunken and unable to get back the power they once had over their audiences. The troupe will also perform ''Rio Seco'' (''Dry River''), a piece about the family vacation from hell. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, ; $20; $15 in advance.

(Dunning) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, concludes its two-month run at the intimate Theater 80 this weekend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell) * PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects. A little mindless, but enormously popular for people of all ages. Three programs alternate for the run ending Aug. 12. Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday nights at 8, and tomorrow at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org, $42. (Rockwell) URBAN BUSH WOMEN 2006 SUMMER INSTITUTE (Tomorrow) In ''Place Matters: A Look at Displacement,'' directed by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and created by 74 dance artists participating in the institute, notions of home and displacement are examined in light of events that include Hurricane Katrina, the slaughters in Darfur and the fighting in Iraq. At 4 and 7 p.m. Kumble Theater, Long Island University, at Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 488-1624 or www.brooklyn.liu.edu/kumbletheater; $10; $2 for children.

(Kinetz) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best-known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter) * metropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Cotter) Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Johnson) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Johnson) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer , through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org.(Johnson) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088 or noguchi.org. (Glueck) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson) * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' This museum is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Mr. Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 or tibordenagy.com, extended through next Friday. (Johnson) 'Your Beauty's Gold is Clay' This well-selected show of ceramicists includes ruggedly sensuous, Abstract Expressionist-style sculptures by Lynda Benglis; delicate and humorously detailed vessels by Kathy Butterly; surrealistically flamboyant large vases by Nicole Cherubini; comical, demonic heads by William King; a wonderful long-haired cat by Anne Arnold; and sweet faux-juvenile sculptures by Jessica Jackson Hutchins. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828 or alexandregallery.com, through next Friday. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Joe Biel With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box, and one of a knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he found. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, goffandrosenthal.com, through Aug. 12. (Johnson) * J. Bennett Fitts: 'No Lifeguard on Duty' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410 or saulgallery.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) * 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200 or matthewmarks.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) Group Show Four interesting Conceptualists: Pierre Bismuth folds a giant reproduction of a Jasper Johns flag painting into a Donald Judd-like box; Ryan Gander makes large photographs of bulletin boards bearing puzzling documents; Karl Haendel covers a wall with his large, handmade graphite copies of consumer-culture ephemera; and T. Kelly Mason constructsa walk-in, padded environment with soft, rain-related sounds and a video. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 19th Street, (212) 206-8710 or cohanandleslie.com, through Aug. 18. (Johnson) Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 421-3292 or pacewildenstein.com, through Sept. 23. (Johnson) 'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 or kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson) 'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764 or photocollect.com, through Aug. 19. (Johnson) Other Galleries Zoe Leonard, Liz Deschenes and Vija Celmins This quietly gripping show of photographs and works derived from photographs includes delicate, hand-drawn images of a spider web, and the ocean's surface in prints by Ms. Celmins; grainy aerial photographs that look as if they were shot from a spy satellite by Ms. Leonard; and Minimalist photograms with silvery surfaces by Ms. Deschenes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757 or tracywilliamsltd.com, through next Friday. (Johnson) Last Chance * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist, whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444 or ubugallery.com; closes today. (Smith) * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766 or crggallery.com; closes today. (Smith) George Herms Starting out as a beatnik in the 1950's, Mr. Herms has been creating and exhibiting his richly poetic assemblages of grungy found materials in California, his home state, for more than a half century. This show's eight works, from 1965 to 2002, variously call to mind Ernst, Duchamp, Cornell and Rauschenberg, but they have as well their own spiritually generous, heartfelt mix of hermetic imagination and Whitmanesque populism. Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 or franklinparrasch.com; closes today. (Johnson) 'How I Finally Accepted Fate' The memoir is the loosely defined theme of this interesting 10-person show. It includes Matt Keegan's video of cheerleaders celebrating his grandmother's 90th birthday; Angela Dufresne's vivid painting of a shirtless man called ''Me as a Communist Male in 'The Red and the White' ''; Carolee Schneemann's patchwork tale about modern love in photographs and typewritten words; and Maureen Duncan's three-and-a-half-hour monologue about her CD collection. EFA Gallery, 323 West 39th Street, (212) 563-5855; closes today. (Johnson) * JUSTIN LOWE: HELTER SWELTER This labor-intensive trompe l'oeil installation passes through the emblematic sites of summer -- an urban bodega, a construction detour and an ice cream truck -- but its chief payoff is a womblike hippie heaven whose floor-of-many-colors is tiled in tightly wound T-shirts. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-0979 or 5begallery.com; closes today. (Smith) 'Money Changes Everything' A show of artworks made at least partly out of actual money: dollar bills, mostly, but Iraqi dinar notes, too. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 630-0722 or schroederromero.com; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212 or salon94.com; closes today. (Smith)",4fd271ac8eb7c8105d82e0d7,15141

Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200. * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Starts previews tonight; opens Thursday. When it originally opened in February, Charles Isherwood wrote: ''Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens'' (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich, who replaces Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' José Rivera, who wrote the screenplay to ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Off Off Broadway 'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'BEOWULF & GRENDEL' (R, 102 minutes) The director Sturla Gunnarsson boils this classic epic down into a generic action flick, complete with sweeping vistas, clanging fights, a chiseled hero and a witchy woman who keeps her front door unlocked for both the good guy and the bad. Every so often a severed head lazily rolls across the frame, though, alas, not often enough. (Dargis) 'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Stephen Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee) 'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis) 'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis) 'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott) 'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) 'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis) 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) 'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott) 'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series ANIMATION AROUND THE WORLD (Through July 31) BAMcinématek's festival of animated films begins Monday with a program of shorts by the Dutch director Paul Driessen, who worked on ''Yellow Submarine.''

The weekend's other features are Hitchcock classics: ''Psycho'' (1960), starring Anthony Perkins as the disturbed motel owner Norman Bates, and ''Rebecca'' (1940), which stars Laurence Olivier (but the film's real villain is the dead title character).

DAVE ALVIN (Tonight) In the Blasters, in X and now on his own, Mr. Alvin has written and sung about outcasts, lovers and criminals, some of the people who share the road with an itinerant musician. He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that strive for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Jon Pareles) * AMADOU AND MARIAM (Sunday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. With Daby Touré and Birdy Nam Nam. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested.

(Sisario) BON JOVI (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album ''New Jersey,'' is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies, and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn't hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 5 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $37.50 to $125. (Pareles) BRAVE COMBO (Wednesday) Brave Combo, on a lifelong mission to prove the malleability of polka, plays an all-request show at Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center's outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing.

(Sisario) BRAVO SILVA, RAISING THE FAWN (Wednesday) Drawing on the spiky and melodic sound of the early Police and U2, the New York band Bravo Silva sings deadpan odes to the city of strangers, though not so deadpan as to exclude playing soaring, ecstatic choruses and having some fun with kitschy keyboards. This month the band has a Wednesday-night residency at Pianos. Also on the bill this week is Raising the Fawn, a group connected to the great Toronto indie-prog collective Broken Social Scene. At 6:30 p.m., 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733; $8. (Sisario) KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammys and had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea.

(Sisario) * DIPLO, CSS, BONDE DO ROLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is also half of Hollertronix, a virtuoso mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. Diplo is touring with that band and another Brazilian group, CSS, whose come-ons are shouted in robotic, broken English (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake'') over bare but exuberant art-funk.

(Sisario) JOHN HIATT, NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tuesday) Mr. Hiatt has rhymed amoeba with Queen of Sheba; his songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. He performs with a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey. The North Mississippi Allstars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $30. (Pareles) I LOVE YOU BUT I'VE CHOSEN DARKNESS (Wednesday) All is cold, echoey gloom in the music of this five-piece band from Austin, Tex., which borrows its spacious sound from Joy Division and its faint vocals from the shoe-gazer British bands of the late 1980's like My Bloody Valentine. With the Big Sleep and Asobi Seksu, a Brooklyn group whose new album, ''Citrus'' (Friendly Fire), shows a fine command of the shoe-gazer sound. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 in advance, $16 at the door.

At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $354.50 tickets remaining. (Sisario) MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980's this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. With Major Stars. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario) MOBB DEEP, RAEKWON (Wednesday) Mobb Deep, a rap duo from Queens long admired by connoisseurs for its grim and vivid rhymes, was recently taken under 50 Cent's wing, with one result that you might expect: its new album, ''Blood Money'' (G Unit/Interscope), had its debut in the Top 10. Also on the bill is Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, and a long lineup of opening acts including the Boot Camp Clik. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario) MUNICIPAL WASTE (Tonight) Seemingly everything about the mid-1980's thrash metal of groups like D.R.I. and Anthrax is lovingly and skillfully recreated by this band from Richmond, Va., from the high-octane riffs and stomping mosh-pit rhythms all the way to the cartoonish, apocalyptic album-cover art. With Annihilation Time, Splitting Headache, Clockcleaner and Dustheads. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $9. (Sisario) NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tomorrow) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteño, the vibrant border style of oompah brass and accordion known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. With Grupo Soñador. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) OZOMATLI (Tonight) Ozomatli makes what might be called political party music. It's a Los Angeles band that is determined to annex every pan-American party groove from funk to samba to Mexican cumbia in its consciousness-raising songs. With Outernational. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door.

(Pareles) * SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) One of the most tastefully programmed indie-rock festivals in the country, The Village Voice's annual afternoon of noise and sea mist takes place on two stages beside the Coney Island boardwalk, surrounded by hot-dog vendors and the screams of roller-coaster riders. The lineup this year includes the neo-disco Scissor Sisters; the exuberantly sarcastic Art Brut; the Stills, a Canadian band with a moody, shimmering take on the sound of New York bands like Interpol and the Strokes; Stars, a witty and eloquent indie-cabaret band from Toronto; She Wants Revenge and Dirty on Purpose, two more groups with gloom fetishes; Tapes 'n Tapes, from Minneapolis, whose dry rhapsodies recall Pavement and the early Pixies; the bluesy and rough-hewn Deadboy and the Elephantmen; and Man Man, the Rogers Sisters, Priestess, Celebration, Serena Maneesh and the Cribs. From noon to 9 p.m., Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (212) 475-4022; free. (Sisario) SOUNDS OF THE UNDERGROUND TOUR (Tomorrow) An afternoon of fast, pummeling heavy metal characterized by lots of death-and-gore-obsessed lyrics, with As I Lay Dying, Cannibal Corpse, In Flames, Trivium, Terror, Black Dahlia Murder and Through the Eyes of the Dead. And since the vaudevillian horror-metal band Gwar is on the bill, there will also be a fair complement of monsters with ripped limbs spurting fake, multicolored blood. At noon, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Sisario) MATTHEW SWEET AND SUSANNA HOFFS (Monday) Mr. Sweet, the power-pop songwriter with a sensitive side (''Girlfriend''), and Ms. Hoffs, the lead singer of the Bangles, indulge their love of jangly 1960's pop, playing songs from ''Under the Covers, Vol. 1'' (Shout Factory), their recent joint album of loving versions of songs by the Beatles, Love, the Zombies, the Mamas and the Papas, and others. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. A.C.T.I.O.N. 4 (Wednesday) It may sound like a coalition of superheroes, or a TV news team, but this quartet is actually a progressive jazz ensemble built around the compositions of the bassist Sean Conly.

At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen) LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Through Sunday) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for Mr. Donaldson, a veteran alto saxophonist who receives strong support here from Kyle Koehler on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen) MAYNARD FERGUSON & HIS BIG BOP NOUVEAU BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) His signature high notes have inevitably lost some luster, but Mr. Ferguson is still a bravura trumpeter and charismatic front man, and this 11-piece ensemble, under the musical direction of the drummer Stockton Helbing, suits both sets of skills. (Through July 23.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) * JAZZ IN JULY (Tuesday through Thursday) A year ago, the pianist Bill Charlap presided over his first season as artistic director of this venerable traditional jazz series, successfully clearing the bar set by his predecessor, Dick Hyman. The new season begins next week, with guest-laden tributes to Duke Ellington (Tuesday), Mr. Hyman (Wednesday) and Thelonious Monk (Thursday). Wynton Marsalis, making an appearance on the Monk evening, provides the most potent dose of jazz celebrity; but among this festival's regular patronage, Mr. Hyman himself looms just as large. Tickets will go quickly, if they haven't already. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500 or www.92y.org, $50. (Chinen) LATIN IN MANHATTAN FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's second annual Latin jazz festival started this week with Claudia Acuña, a vocalist guided by the pulse and passion of her native Chile, who plays through Sunday with a strong quintet.

At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) BEN MONDER GROUP (Sunday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else.

At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen) MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen) * JOE WILDER QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The trumpeter Joe Wilder, still playing well in his mid-80's, has had a wealth of professional experience both in and out of jazz.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at the New York City Opera, and lots of people drive up to Cooperstown, N.Y., to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly superior place to see and hear these productions than the cavernous New York State Theater. The company opened its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. This week's schedule also includes Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tomorrow night at 8; ''Barbiere'': Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112. (Allan Kozinn) 'GRENDEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The wall works! The Lincoln Center Festival is breathing easy. As everyone seems to know by now, the Los Angeles Opera's premiere of ''Grendel,'' the operatic adaptation of John Gardner's 1971 novel, a retelling of the epic poem ''Beowulf,'' composed by Elliot Goldenthal and directed by Julie Taymor, had to be postponed when the 16-ton rotating wall that dominated the set would not rotate. Now installed at the New York State Theater, the wall is operating smoothly and the elaborate production, complete with Ms. Taymor's trademark puppets, tree-man creatures and flying dancers, seems glitch-free. Alas, Mr. Goldenthal's derivative music is like an ominous and obvious film score and the opera is weighted down with philosophical mumbo-jumbo. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; $40 to $200. (Anthony Tommasini) New Jersey Opera Theater (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the pre-eminent opera company for the state. Besides presenting performances, the company offers master classes and educational outreach programs. The productions include Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn, and an intriguing double bill of Puccini's comedy ''Gianni Schicchi'' and ''Buoso's Ghost,'' a one-act work from 1996 by Michael Ching, which picks up the story of the clever Schicchi where Puccini's opera leaves off. Steven Condy sings Schicchi in both works; James Caraher conducts. ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''Schicchi'' and ''Buoso'': tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49. (Tommasini) Classical Music ASTON MAGNA (Tonight and tomorrow) This venerable early-music festival focuses on Mozart and Schubert this weekend, with Sharon Baker as the soprano soloist in groups of songs by each composer, and the violinist Daniel Stepner and the fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout offering sonatas and fantasies.

The Sequenza Trio, with the violinist Mark Kaplan, the cellist Adrian Brendel and the pianist Yael Weiss, takes over tomorrow and Sunday to play works by Martinu, Schubert (the great E-flat Trio, Op. 100) and Paul Chihara's ''Ain't No Sunshine.'' On Thursday, the Gala String Quartet and Olga Vinokur, the pianist, join forces for Mozart's chamber version of his Piano Concerto No. 12 (K. 414) and the Schumann Piano Quintet (Op. 44).

(Kozinn) 'BEOWuLF' (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Lincoln Center Festival offers Benjamin Bagby's smaller, faster take on ''Beowulf'' as a complement to the opera ''Grendel'' playing nearby. At 8:30 p.m., Drama Theater at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street, (212) 721-6500; $45, with limited availability. (Bernard Holland) CARAMOOR (Tonight through Sunday, Thursday) The chamber ensemble Opus One frames its program of piano quartets tonight in favorites, with Mozart's Quartet in E flat (K. 493) to begin and Dvorak's Quartet in E flat (Op. 87) to close. Between them it offers a more recent adventure, George Tsontakis's Piano Quartet No. 3. Tomorrow night Michael Barrett conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's in the premiere of a Piano Concerto by John Musto, Caramoor's stylistically omnivorous composer in residence. Also on the program are Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3 and Schumann's ''Spring'' Symphony.

On Thursday, the brilliant American pianist Christopher Taylor will perform Messiaen's complete ''Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jésus,'' a two-hour workout that includes some of the most difficult and complex yet sublime and ecstatic music ever written for piano.

(Kozinn) * INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) This expansive festival of master classes and concerts runs through the rest of July, and tends to draw the biggest crowds of all the Mannes College of Music's summer series. Jerome Rose, the institute's director, plays the first faculty concert on Sunday, with works by Mozart, Schumann, Chopin (the four Ballades) and Paul Schoenfield. On Monday Fabio Bidini plays Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and Beethoven's ''Waldstein'' and ''Appassionata'' Sonatas. On Tuesday Steven Mayer offers a virtuoso program that moves from Weber and Schumann through Ives, Gottschalk and James P. Johnson into jazz pieces by Jelly Roll Morton and Art Tatum. On Wednesday Nikolai Demidenko plays Schubert, Liszt and Bach. On Thursday Jeffrey Swann offers a lecture-recital, ''In Search of Lost Time: Music in the World of Marcel Proust,'' that includes works by Franck, Fauré, Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Reynaldo Hahn and Wagner. At 8 p.m., Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, Ext. 4858; $25. (Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday) The Philharmonic has left the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. Notably, the conductors and soloists for both programs this summer are dynamic women. The orchestra's impressive associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8. The series ends on Tuesday with the adventurous Marin Alsop conducting John Adams's ''Chairman Dances,'' Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1, with the virtuosic Leila Josefowicz as soloist, and Beethoven's always-popular Fifth Symphony. Expect these concerts, as usual, to draws tens of thousands of people for picnics in the parks and music under the stars (if nature cooperates). There will be fireworks after each performance. Tonight at 8, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island; tomorrow at 8 p.m., Heckscher State Park, East Islip, N.Y.; Monday at 8 p.m., Van Cortlandt Park, Broadway and West 246th Street, the Bronx; Tuesday at 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park; (212) 875-5709.

Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $100. (John Rockwell) CAPACITOR (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) From San Francisco, Capacitor creates pieces based on science. In ''Digging in the Dark'' the focus is on modern geophysics and acrobatic, virtuosic movement. Through July 30. Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or capacitor.org; $35. (Jennifer Dunning) CENTRAL PARK SUMMERSTAGE (Tonight) The Stephen Petronio Company, known for its stylish, cheeky, high-energy dance, will perform a program featuring two pieces set to music by Rufus Wainwright that will be sung live in part by the Young People's Chorus of New York City. At 8 p.m. Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, enter at Fifth Avenue and 69th Street or Central Park West and 72nd Street, (212) 360-1399 or summerstage.org; free. (Dunning) CHASHAMA OASIS FESTIVAL 2006 (Today and Monday through Thursday) Artists of all disciplines -- some, we suspect, wildly undisciplined, in the grand tradition of Chashama productions -- will perform in a Midtown window. Today, and Monday through next Friday from noon to 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 7 p.m., 217 East 42nd Street, between Second and Third Avenues, chashama.org; free. (Dunning) Chunky Move (Tonight and tomorrow) Australian men apparently have dancing difficulties too; perhaps not these particular men, though. Using video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco) COMPANY C CONTEMPORARY BALLET (Opens Thursday). A 12-member ballet troupe from San Francisco with an eclectic repertory presents works by Twyla Tharp, Patrick Corbin, Alexander Proia and its director, Charles Anderson. Through July 23. At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479; $25, $20 students and 65+. (Jack Anderson) PAULA HUNTER (Today through Thursday) Ms. Hunter will perform ''I Am Karen Finley,'' an absurdist performance solo, as a free dance installation in a window in the Theater District.

(Dunning) LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 2006 (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company examines issues relating to patriotism in ''Blind Date.'' At 8 p.m., LaGuardia Concert Hall, Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street, (212) 721-6500 or lincolncenter.org; $50. (Anderson) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell) * PILOBOLUS (Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects. A little mindless, maybe, but enormously popular for people of all ages. Monday is a special opening event combining parts of the two programs that will alternate for the rest of the run. Through Aug. 12. Monday through Thursday nights at 8, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org. $42. (Rockwell) 'RIVER DEEP, A TRIBUTE TO TINA TURNER' (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) Gabrielle Lansner pays tribute to this singer, who is played by Pat Hall, in a multimedia production set to music by Philip Hamilton. Through July 29. Tonight, and Tuesday through Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, (212) 279-4200 or gabriellelansner.com; $35.

At 6 p.m., Union Square Park, Broadway and 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 460-1208 or unionsquarenyc.org; free. (Anderson) * TAP CITY 2006 (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) The festivities continue with performances of ''Tap Internationals'' tonight; ''Tap Forward,'' a program of contemporary choreography, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday nights; and ''Tap and Song,'' whose performers include Mable Lee and the festival director, Tony Waag, on Sunday and Wednesday nights. Tonight at 7 and 9:30; tomorrow and Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; and Tuesday and Thursday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, (212) 239-6200 and atdf.org; $40. (Dunning) THOMAS/ORTIZ DANCE (Wednesday through Thursday) Ted Thomas and Frances Ortiz combine urban athleticism and Latin sensuality in choreographic explorations of socially relevant themes. Through July 22. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $15, $25. (Anderson) DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning) VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Tonight through Sunday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell.

Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $20; $15, students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) Bruce Museum: 'Best in Show: Dogs in Art From the Renaissance to the Present,' through Aug. 27. This show is a dog lover's picnic, with paintings that celebrate canis lupus familiaris and its wayward ways. 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich, Conn.; (203) 869-0376. (Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/ Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson) * The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith) * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith) * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) 'Small Wonders' Bucking the big-picture trend, this absorbing show presents 45 black-and-white photographs ranging from palm to postage-stamp size. They include classic portraits by Edward Weston and Berenice Abbott; André Kertesz's William-Blake-like image of a naked man walking into a field of tall grass; and Walter Auerbach's picture of Willem de Kooning's studio circa 1950. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 989-7600, through Aug. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'About Light' Some works in this show, like Sean Scully's blocky grid painting and Philip Guston's smudgy gray abstraction, absorb more than emit light. Others, including Thomas Pihl's smooth, pink monochromes; Alex Katz's small nocturnal pictures of lighted apartment-building windows; and Richard Pousette-Dart's pulsating, pointillist field, seem to glow from within. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Aug. 4. (Johnson) 'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson) * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith) 'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson) 'I'm not here. This isn't happening' With possibly the best title of the summer season, this group show includes Michelle Lopez's canny, neo-Surrealistic sculptures; Ronnie Bass's incantatory sound-and-video installation in a simulated old ship's cabin; Terry Haggerty's mesmerizing pattern paintings; Katarina Burin's noirish combinations of watercolor and found photography; Damien Cadio's enigmatic, painterly narratives; and Jim Gaylord's explosive, loosely Cubist paintings of natural and artificial fragments. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)Smith) * THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through tomorrow. (Smith) 'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson) Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson) * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter) Other Galleries 'How I Finally Accepted Fate' The memoir is the loosely defined theme of this interesting 10-person show. It includes Matt Keegan's video of cheerleaders celebrating his grandmother's 90th birthday; Angela Dufresne's vivid painting of a shirtless man called ''Me as a Communist Male in 'The Red and the White' ''; Carolee Schneemann's patchwork tale about modern love in photographs and typewritten words; and Maureen Duncan's three-and-a-half-hour monologue about her CD collection. EFA Gallery, 323 West 39th Street, (212) 563-5855, through July 28. (Johnson) Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson) Last Chance Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black-and-white grid painted on the walls, a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design, and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love,'' depicting the goddess of love and the god of war in an intimate moment brokered by Cupid, as Mars's sexy horse looks on. The other works are a little more staid, but the painting in them is equally gorgeous. (See above.) 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closes Sunday. (Glueck) EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166; closes tomorrow. (Glueck) Cosima von Bonin: 'Relax, It's Only a Ghost' Various two- and three-dimensional objects -- including stuffed animals like the ones you might find in a high-end toy store -- and Rorschach test patterns stitched to colorful bedspreads add up to a familiar critique of consumerism. Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467; closes today. (Johnson) Invisible Might: Works from 1965-1971' This luminous group show about the euphoric convergence of Minimalism and new technologies in the late 1960's and early 70's includes a smoky glass cube by Larry Bell; a solid black plastic cube by John McCracken; a tall, clear acrylic prism by Robert Irwin; a beautiful aqua-green light projection by James Turrell; a yellow molded plastic relief by Craig Kauffman; and a corner composition of elastic cords and bent metal rods by Fred Sandback. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1785; closes today. (Johnson)",4fd2af338eb7c8105d89de21,14699

'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' In previews; opens on Monday. Dan Fogler (''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'') plays one of the three surviving members of the SS Carcass. Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the math prof, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'DRUG BUDDY' The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann. But ''Drug Buddy'' leaves barely a bruise, let alone a buzz (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Rob Kendt) 'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Zinoman) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates) 'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Brantley) 'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood) 'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison-d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway '¡EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Anne Midgette) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates) 'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH' A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates) 'WASPS IN BED' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis) 'BLACK GOLD' (No rating, 78 minutes, in English, Oromifa and Amharic) This documentary tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story. The giants in this case are multinational corporations that control the worldwide coffee market. The heroic little guy, Tadesse Meskela, who represents the Oromo Coffee Farmers Co-op Union, devotes himself tirelessly to traveling the world looking for buyers who will pay a fair price for the beans harvested by the country's 70,000 coffee farmers. (Stephen Holden) 'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is tireder than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott) 'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee) 'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis) * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott) 'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) * 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee) 'JET LI'S FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee) 'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) 'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern) * 'OUT OF PLACE: MEMORIES OF EDWARD SAID' and 'EDWARD SAID: THE LAST INTERVIEW' (No rating, 138 minutes and 114 minutes, in English, Arabic and Hebrew) Two documentaries about the Palestinian writer and thinker Edward Said explore his life, his chronic alienation and his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Loosely framed by readings from Mr. Said's 1999 memoir of the same title, ''Out of Place: Memories of Edward Said'' is less a biography than a rambling meditation on exile, identity and the psychological scars of dispossession. More satisfying is the complex portrait provided by ''Edward Said: The Last Interview,'' a riveting record of Mr. Said's 2002 conversation with the journalist Charles Glass. Engrossing and wide-ranging, the film proves that a couch, a camera and a great mind can be all the inspiration a filmmaker needs. (Catsoulis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis) * 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott) * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis) 'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee) 'WRESTLING WITH ANGELS: PLAYWRIGHT TONY KUSHNER' (No rating, 98 minutes) In this entertaining but shallow documentary portrait of the playwright Tony Kushner, its likable subject contradicts the cliché image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He comes across as a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. (Holden) Film Series 'ÉCLATS DE RIRE' (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is screening French comedies every Tuesday. This week's films are Josiane Balasko's ''Gazon Maudit'' (1995), about a husband-wife-lesbian ménage à trois, and Albert Dupontel's ''Bernie'' (1996), about a 30-year-old orphan in search of his parents.

(Anita Gates) 'LOOKING IN/LOOKING OUT: DOCUMENTARIES FROM SCANDINAVIA' (Through Dec. 16) Scandinavia House's festival of documentaries from five countries begins on Wednesday. This week's films are Pirjo Honkasalo's ''Cinderella of Tallinn'' (1995), from Finland, a portrait of an Estonian woman who became rich by selling the Soviets' heavy metal leftovers, and Erik Gandini and Tarik Saleh's ''Gitmo -- The New Rules of War'' (2006), from Sweden, which visits Guantánamo Bay, Washington, Stockholm and Abu Ghraib. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) 'MADE IN NY; (Through Dec. 31) The Museum of Modern Art's three-month series of notable films made in the city continues this weekend with a half-dozen features. They include Woody Allen's ''Manhattan'' (1979), with its adoring shots of bridges, parks and gardens; Louis Malle's two-man feast, ''My Dinner With André'' (1981); and Gordon Parks's ''Shaft'' (1971), about detective style in Harlem. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) 'NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL RETROSPECTIVE: 50 YEARS OF JANUS FILMS' (Through Oct. 27) The Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting a monthlong salute to Janus, the long-revered distributor of foreign films. This weekend's films include Luis Buñuel's ''Viridiana'' (1961), about a young nun with an unpleasant uncle; Agnès Varda's ''Cléo From 5 to 7'' (1962), about a woman nervously awaiting medical test results; and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ''The Seven Samurai'' (1954), the original Eastern western. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) 'OTTO PREMINGER: NOTORIOUS' (Through Oct. 29) The Museum of Modern Art's nine-film retrospective of Preminger's work (he would have turned 100 this year) continues this weekend with ''Advise and Consent'' (1962). The film, about Washingtonians who maneuver, stars Henry Fonda and a scene-stealing Charles Laughton. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. With Spinto Band. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17.50 in advance, $19 at the door.

(Ben Sisario) BECK (Wednesday) Since he broke through with the slacker anthem ''Loser'' in 1994, Beck has waffled between snidely ironic hip-hop pastiche and glum acoustic balladry. His latest, ''The Information'' (Interscope), is in the hip-hop category, with the kind of pop-culture crazy-quilt lyrics that only Beck could come up with: ''I got a silicon Bible song/Paranoid Jumbotron.'' With Spank Rock. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50. (Sisario) * CBGB (Tonight through Sunday) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the storied Bowery dive that in the 1970's incubated New York's greatest generation of punk rock. The club must close by the end of the month, and the shows this weekend have been billed as its last. The Dictators, whose muscular three-chord chants are paragons of tidy melody and obnoxious humor, play tonight and tomorrow night. Also tomorrow, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie offer an acoustic set. Sunday night is the big blowout with Patti Smith and her band. At 8 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; sold out. (Sisario) C. J. CHENIER (Sunday) The son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, C. J. Chenier picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Jon Pareles) DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tonight) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $19. (Pareles) DJ SHADOW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The high priest of disorienting turntable collage makes an appearance in support of his first new album in four years, ''The Outsider'' (Island).

(Sisario) DUB TRIO (Thursday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 a set. (Sisario) VINCE GILL (Monday) This sweet-voiced country classicist is touring with a 17-piece band and an especially big addition to his repertory: on Tuesday he will release ''These Days'' (MCA Nashville), a four-CD set of all new material, featuring Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, Gretchen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes and enough other stars to fill a downtown Nashville honky-tonk. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 to $50. (Sisario) GOLDFRAPP (Wednesday) Led by Allison Goldfrapp, a techno glamourpuss part Marlene Dietrich and part Debbie Harry, this British duo plays cool, vaguely futuristic electronica. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario) JOLIE HOLLAND (Wednesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming, deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) INDIGO GIRLS (Tonight) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Roman Candle. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $30 and $40. (Pareles) * LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Tuesday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to close, bass-heavy Zulu harmony on Paul Simon's ''Graceland,'' is at Carnegie Hall for the first time since appearing with Mr. Simon there 19 years ago. Guests include Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Mahotella Queens, Vusi Mahlasela and Pete Seeger. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $21 to $72. (Sisario) JENNY LEWIS (Tonight) Already the sad-eyed, short-skirted princess of indie rock as the lead singer of Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis made an inspired step with her first solo album, whose luscious country-gospel ruminations of romantic and spiritual doubt (''It's not that I believe in your almighty/But I might as well as insurance or bail'') made her its Dusty Springfield as well. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario) PET SHOP BOYS (Tomorrow) The British duo that perfected the pouty and aloof techno-pop of Human League returned this year with ''Fundamental'' (Capitol), a reunion with Trevor Horn, one of its 1980's producers. Only the Pet Shop Boys can sing jabberwocky lines like ''I thought I heard a train/Down in the cemetery/Cellophane'' and make them sound sexy and evil. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Sisario) RASCAL FLATTS (Tomorrow) The sweetest, most tooth-rotting bubblegum is always the best. This pop-country trio -- big emphasis on pop -- specializes in a kind of mawkish sentimentality that has to be admired for sheer shamelessness, as in ''Skin (Sarabeth),'' an after-school special with a waltz beat about a girl with leukemia: ''It would be a mistake/For someone to take/A girl with no hair to the prom.'' (Her date shaves his head in sympathy.) At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $44.50 to $84.50. (Sisario) RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, MARS VOLTA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though their transformation from sex-mad punk-funk pranksters to crooning penitents is pretty much complete, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are not above the occasional appearance dressed only in tube socks (not on their feet). With the Mars Volta, leaders of the unlikely renaissance of byzantine prog-metal. At 8 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $63. (Sisario) ROYAL DRUMMERS OF BURUNDI (Tomorrow and Monday) First heard by most Western listeners as the spooky, lusty pulse on Joni Mitchell's 1975 album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' these musicians and dancers -- who sometimes call themselves the Master Drummers of Burundi, or simply the Drummers of Burundi -- conjure an elemental musical force through ritualized unison percussion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. Sunday at 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Sisario) EARL SCRUGGS (Tonight) Bluegrass banjo as we know it simply would not exist without Earl Scruggs, who joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and proceeded to revolutionize banjo playing with a three-finger picking style that accelerates to ballistic speeds. At 7:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40. (Pareles) ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55. (Pareles) SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tonight) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. At 8:30, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles) * 'THE SPIRIT OF FÈS' (Tomorrow) The Festival of Sacred Music in Fès, Morocco, is the inspiration for this ecumenical concert. It includes Daqqa Roudania, a group from Morocco, performing ecstatic, percussion-driven Sufi music and dance; Gerard Edery singing Sephardic songs that hark back to Renaissance music; Susan Hellauer from Anonymous 4, singing Gregorian chant; the South Indian classical singer Aruna Sairam, with Hindu devotional music; and Arabic music from Zafer Tawil, playing oud and violin, and Jamey Haddad on percussion. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $42. (Pareles) ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden) TILLY AND THE WALL (Tuesday) An indie-rock band playing tuneful, yearning anthems of sexuality and confusion is nothing new, but this Omaha quintet has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: the percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With Northern State. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of Brooklyn's most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. With Grizzly Bear. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) YOU AM I (Wednesday and Thursday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. * SATHIMA BEA BENJAMIN (Tuesday) As a singer, Ms. Benjamin shines on standards without forsaking her South African heritage, a subtle achievement represented on a career-spanning new compilation called ''Song Spirit'' (Ekapa). She performs here in celebration of her 70th birthday, with instrumental support from the pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen) CHRIS BOTTI/JOHN PIZZARELLI (Tonight) Mr. Botti has emerged as the lite-jazz hero of our time, a trumpeter whose photogenic presence and brooding sensuality both suit the current notion of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. His low-gloss polish is likable, and in concert he tends to stretch out a bit with his band, which is first-rate. For a more buoyant take on jazz-pop crossover, though, look to the other half of this bill, featuring Mr. Pizzarelli, the ever-breezy guitarist and singer. At 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Chinen) DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Don Byron has lately been playing more tenor saxophone, a development that motivated his latest concept album, ''Do the Boomerang'' (Blue Note). It's a tribute to the Motown saxophonist-singer Junior Walker, by a clutch of musicians equally at home playing jazz and soul: the guitarist David Gilmore, the keyboardist George Colligan, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Rodney Holmes. One of the two vocalists on the album, Chris Thomas King, will also appear. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25; $30 tonight and tomorrow. (Chinen) REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter is a jazz violinist of uncommon accomplishment: a few years ago she became the first African-American musician to play Paganini's cherished instrument in Genoa, Italy, and a few weeks ago she received a prestigious ''genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation. Her recent album ''I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey'' (Verve) honors the memory of her mother by reinterpreting some of the prewar popular songs she loved. (Through Oct. 21.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone cuts cleanly through the angular free-funk of his signature ensemble, which includes Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Tyshawn Sorey on drums and, on Wednesday only, Thomas Morgan on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen) COOPER-MOORE QUARTET/MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Tomorrow) The man known as Cooper-Moore, an extreme polyglot even by avant-garde standards, leads a band that features his own handmade instruments alongside the alto saxophone of Darius Jones and the percussion of Juma Santos and Chad Taylor. Matana Roberts, a husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of the A.A.C.M., is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; her group, performing in a later set, includes the tenor saxophonist Matt Bauder, the bassist Tom Abbs and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez SEA Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $20 a set. (Chinen) EDDIE DANIELS's 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels will reach standard retirement age on Thursday, though he doesn't seem to have much interest in laying back. The first of his four nights at Iridium will feature numerous guests, including his fellow clarinetists Ken Peplowski, Ron Odrich and Paquito D'Rivera (who also plays alto saxophone). The house rhythm section will consist of Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight through Sunday night) This stylistically expansive series concludes this weekend, after a month of horn-centric programming. Tonight the trumpeters John McNeil and Ron Horton jointly present a group that also includes a third trumpeter, the festival's founder, Dave Douglas; tomorrow there will be sets led by Butch Morris and then Ted Daniel. The series finale, a benefit for music programs in New York public schools, will feature an honor roll of guests, including the composer and alto saxophonist John Zorn, the bassist Henry Grimes and the Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $15, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-6377, fontmusic.org; $20 to $100. (Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band -- which has a strong recent album, ''Dizzy's Business'' (Telarc) -- includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a natural choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Oct. 22.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.net; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday) ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note) is the sixth album by the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, and one of his strongest; it's an interpretation of music from two Duke Ellington suites, along with several original themes. As he does on the album, Mr. Harris augments his working quartet here with the trombonist Steve Turre, the clarinetist Mark Vinci, the flutist Anne Drummond, the cellist Louise Dubin and the violist Junah Chung. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Chinen) JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion with an engagement replete with such special guests as the trumpeter Clark Terry (tonight and tomorrow) and the saxophonist and flutist James Moody (Sunday), who have both infused their octogenarian years with youthful brio. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) RODNEY KENDRICK (Tonight) Mr. Kendrick is a commanding pianist who has gradually been returning to the spotlight after a bit of a hiatus. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattn, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen) * LATIN JAZZ CONCERT USA (Thursday) A rich bonanza of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American artists, including the conga legend Candido Camero, the flutist Dave Valentin, the singer Xiomara Laugart and the guitarist and singer David Oquendo, among many others. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $30 to $60. (Chinen) BEN MONDER (Wednesday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. He will present some of the same material here, with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He is performing with a small group featuring the pianist Misha Piatigorsky. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO (Wednesday) Serpentine lyricism and angular forms are major attributes of ''Dachau,'' an album released last year by the guitarist Michael Mussillami on his own Playscape label. Joined by the bassist Joe Fonda and the drummer George Schuller, he'll revisit that recording, as well as a newer one, ''Fragile Forms,'' also on Playscape. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) TED NASH QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Ted Nash has proved to be a smart and resourceful bandleader, especially for ensembles like this one, which has Marcus Printup on trumpet, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), the latest recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) AARON PARKS QUARTET (Tonight) Aaron Parks, a promising young pianist who has turned heads for the past few years in Terence Blanchard's working band, leads a quartet full of fine players: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen) SECTION QUARTET/TRAVIS SULLIVAN'S BJORKESTRA (Thursday) Two young ensembles, each focused on repertory of a contemporary strain: the Section Quartet takes a crack at the Radiohead album ''OK Computer,'' while the Bjorkestra scores the music of Bjork for big band. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 ($20 in advance). (Chinen) US FREE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Andrew Cyrille and the bassist Henry Grimes are members of an avant-garde jazz generation that came of age in the 1960's and 70's, while the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is a comparably newer arrival who has earned respect in his peer group and beyond. The trio has a goofy name that will probably ring true, with collectivity and freedom high on the agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen) * BEBO VALDÉS (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Valdés, a pianist, composer and august figure in the history of Cuban music, won a Grammy and a Latin Grammy last year for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54). The centerpiece of that album is ''Suite Cubana,'' an opus for big band; he will conduct it here with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a resident ensemble of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Valdés, who turned 88 this week, will also play the piano with musicians culled from the ranks of the orchestra, including some who appeared on the album. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo; Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta; Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard; and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette) 'CARMEN' (Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who made his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Midgette) 'The ELIxIr of love' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elixir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Monday and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. The cast includes Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. On Thursday Darina Takova takes over the role of Marguerite, and Fernando de la Mora replaces Mr. Vargas. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn) 'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) This wild and woolly exercise in hate and mayhem continues at the Metropolitan Opera, with stirring music, old-fashioned production values and a strong cast that includes Violeta Urmana, Olga Borodina and Aquiles Machado. On Wednesday Aprile Millo replaces Ms. Urmana. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Bernard Holland) * 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson is Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. In the crucial role of Ilia, Nicole Heaston takes the place of Dorothea Röschmann in tomorrow's performance. James Levine conducts. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tuesday) The abstract staging in Anthony Minghella's 0visually beautiful production deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) 'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow, and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Met. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of this frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Lehar operetta. It will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini) 'ORPHEUS' (Tonight) Next season at Glimmerglass is under the star of Orpheus, not figuratively but literally: All four operas represent different takes on the Orpheus legend, from Offenbach's irreverent satire to Philip Glass's ''Orphée.'' In a kind of preview recital tonight, excerpts from all five operas (the others are by Monteverdi, Gluck and Haydn) will join other Orpheus songs by Vaughan Williams and Schubert. Among the good young singers are the sopranos Caroline Worra and Michael Maniaci -- yes, he's a man, and he will sing the lead in the Gluck/Berlioz version. At 7:30, Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 590-0392, www.themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Midgette) * 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tomorrow) Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera has revived its 1975 production of this work, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini) 'VIOLET FIRE' (Wednesday) Jon Gibson, best known as an early and steadfast member of the Philip Glass Ensemble, has created this multimedia opera about Nikola Tesla, the early-20th-century scientist and inventor who made early breakthroughs in radio broadcasting, electricity and robotics. Miriam Seidel wrote the libretto, and Terry O'Reilly (a director of the Mabou Mines theater company) directs the impressionistic staging. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Kozinn) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' is under way at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and believable Pamina, and Nathan Gunn uses his vibrant baritone and dramatic energy to create an instantly appealing Papageno. Their charisma somewhat overshadows Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer) Classical Music * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This orchestra opens its season with the world premieres of Michael Gantonska's ''After the Wings of Migratory Birds,'' Evan Ziporyn's ''Big Grenadilla,'' Brad Lubman's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and Corey Dargel's ''All the Notes and Rhythms I've Ever Loved.'' Also on the program are recent works by Michael Gandolfi and Susie Ibarra, and an oldie -- O.K., an American classic -- by Charles Ives. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $40. (Kozinn) APOLLO'S FIRE BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) ''Bach in Context'' is the title of the Miller Theater series, and this installment contextualizes Johann Sebastian by presenting him in tandem with his friend and rival Telemann, and letting the audience judge between them. The news is the New York debut of the renowned, Cleveland-based and reportedly excellent baroque orchestra Apollo's Fire. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $15 for students. (Midgette) CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff brings his cutely named ensemble to Alice Tully Hall for two all-Mozart programs. At 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland) * LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) After a neurological condition rendered his right hand nearly useless more than 40 years ago, the pianist Leon Fleisher, now 78, spent years performing only left-hand repertory. But thanks to new treatments, he has been making a remarkable comeback. His Carnegie Hall recital features some works from his new CD, ''Leon Fleisher: The Journey'' (Vangard Classics), including Bach's ''Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Dearly Beloved Brother'' and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) and Stravinsky's Serenade in A. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88. (Schweitzer) ANNE-MARIE MCDERMOTT (Thursday) Ms. McDermott, one of New York's more interesting pianists and musicians, has a go at Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30. (Holland) MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) A new piece by the unquenchable Elliott Carter called ''In the Distances of Sleep'' will be offered by this adventurous and accomplished offshoot of James Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The program includes Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet and the Mendelssohn Octet. At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts may not have the high profile that Leonard Bernstein once brought to them, but they tend to be well-planned and engaging. Tomorrow Delta David Gier conducts ''The Ages of Music: Baroque,'' the first in a series of programs that will survey music history. On the regular subscription series this week the brilliant American conductor David Robertson leads works by Stravinsky and Mozart, including a violin concerto by each, with Gil Shaham as soloist. Then on Thursday Avery Fisher Hall becomes a movie palace when the dynamic young Xian Zhang conducts Prokofiev's pulsating score for Sergei Eisenstein's epic film ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938), while that cinematic masterpiece is screened. Don't bring popcorn. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 2 (Young People's Concert) and 8 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96; remaining tickets for the Young People's Concert are $8 to $24. (Tommasini) 'PROMENADE CONCERT' (Tonight) The ever-inventive George Steel has assembled a program of rarities, both light and serious, in the tradition of the popular (and popularly priced) Promenades concerts. For the occasion, Mr. Steel is conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble and the Gotham City Orchestra, with Tiffany Jackson, soprano, and Alexandra Cooke, mezzo-soprano. The program includes music by Lalo, Gounod, Chabrier, Villette, Schmitt and Messiaen. At 8, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $10. (Kozinn) STEVE REICH TRIBUTE (Sunday) As part of its celebration of Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum has assembled a four-hour concert of his music and the works of younger composers whose music he influenced. The selections run from Mr. Reich's early phase piece ''It's Gonna Rain'' (1965), through his classic scores of the 1970's and 80's (among them ''Clapping Music,'' ''Music for Mallet Instruments, Voice and Organ'' and ''Vermont Counterpoint'') and more recent works. The performers include several superb new-music bands -- Alarm Will Sound, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, So Percussion and Tactus -- as well as the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson, and the guitarist Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth. At 2 p.m., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free with admission to the museum, which is $15; $10 for students and 62+.

(Schweitzer) * PIETER WISPELWEY (Sunday) Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano have increasingly shown themselves to be a fine large-scale concert for a gifted cellist. Now taking on the corpus -- five sonatas and three sets of variations, with two intermissions -- is this Dutch cellist, whose last cycles in New York have been of the Bach suites. However, he has recorded the Beethoven, to great acclaim, with a regular recital partner who appears with him this weekend, the Croatian pianist Dejan Lazic. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50.

The dissidents and egocentrics will take on Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' in ''Wrestling Dostoyevsky.'' Sounds promising. (Through Oct. 21.)

(Dunning) COMPLEXIONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, formed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is known for attracting superb dancers who tend to be stronger than the choreography on offer. That may not be true this time, since the troupe is presenting Ulysses Dove's rarely seen ''Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven,'' originally choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. Also on the program is a new work, ''Hissy Fits,'' by Mr. Rhoden, and an excerpt from his hyperactive ''Anthem.'' Tomorrow at 7.30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722.

(Dunning) * SARAH MICHELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) This star of downtown experimental modern dance gets her big Next Wave festival break with four performances of a piece called ''Dogs,'' commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and designed for its Harvey Theater space.

At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning) 'PEAK PERFORMANCES' (Thursday) This series aims to provoke, and its choice, Jan Fabre, is said to be a first-rate provocateur. His new ''Quando l'uomo principale e una donna'' (''When the Leading Man Turns Out to Be a Woman'') is an homage to Yves Klein, who used nude women as paintbrushes. Mr. Fabre takes things further by coating the stage floor with olive oil. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning) STEPHEN PETRONIO AND RACOCO PRODUCTIONS (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Petronio and his quicksilver choreography company are featured tomorrow in the Dance at the Winter Garden series. Theater-dance pieces by Racoco Productions on Thursday draw on burlesque and clown and mask work, integrating them with outsider and fine art and traditional dance movement. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 12:30 p.m., World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, stephenpetronio.com, racoco.org; free.

Museums AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common signing language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter) * ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Glueck) * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman) Galleries: Chelsea DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter) DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith) Last Chance BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE' Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * GERALD DAVIS Growing up can be hell, especially if you're an art-loving sissy. This is more or less the story told by Mr. Davis's auspicious New York solo debut. The show is titled ''1986,'' for the year the artist entered his teens, and in several polished autobiographical drawings it illustrates a state of social and psychological crisis already in progress. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) ALICE KÖNTIZ Ambiguity is the thread in this compact show. Its various small sculptures do double duty as furniture, specifically as supports for other art. Formally, each piece looks at once designer-chic and job lot cheap. The gallery installation could be either a showroom or a living room. Or both, which is the point. Hudson Franklin, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) ADAM MCEWEN Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several media and tend to approach ideas at a slant. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on both counts in a solo show of abstract paintings made with chewing gum and photographs of an apartment complex in Queens. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, closes tomorrow. (Cotter) TAYLOR MCKIMENS: 'THE DRIPS' In his second show this artist continues to make highly effective full-scale figures and installations that seem to have escaped from a comic book, which they have. His vision of down-and-out America has intensified and is now dominated by oozing, hairy, often faceless blobs called the Drips. Clementine, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow. (Smith) WALLPAPER LAB In this show 15 artists (including Douglas Gordon, Gary Simmons, Fred Tomaselli and Phoebe Washburn) adapt their art to the wallpaper format. The results vary tremendously, but it is always interesting to see how artistic ideas translate from one medium to another. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012; closes tomorrow. (Smith) AARON YOUNG Before the opening of this show, Mr. Young hired a biker to rev up in the gallery and lay down DeKooningesque tracks of burnt rubber. He also installed painted bronze casts of street curbing and invited skateboarders to perform on them until some of the paint wore off and the gold-colored metal came through. Four ''trick,'' audience-participation paintings hang in the back gallery. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) 'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari and Katharina Fritsch, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org; closes on Monday. (Ken Johnson)",4fd272158eb7c8105d82e984,14565

Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime ''Soap'' star, gives a pocket history of the craft in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings '''My Way,''' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Zinoman) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH' A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). HERE Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) 'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood) 'wasps in bed' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) Off Off Broadway 'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45).

(Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALLENDE: THE DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' A dry history lesson about the final hours of Salvador Allende, the Marxist president of Chile who died in 1973 during a military coup (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'OFF-STAGE: THE WEST VILLAGE FRAGMENTS' A warm-hearted and well-researched mix of walking tour and performance that offers a sampling menu of excerpts from plays from the origins of Off Off Broadway (2:00). Various locations throughout Greenwich Village, (212) 529-3626; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) * 'SEVEN GUITARS' Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes tomorrow. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis) 'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee) 'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee) 'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis) * '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott) 'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee) 'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis) * 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott) 'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott) 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis) 'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Stephen Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) * 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee) 'jet li's FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) 'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis) * 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott) * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) * 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis) 'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott) Film Series J'AIME LE CINÉMA AMÉRICAIN: AGNÈS B SELECTS (Through Wednesday) The French fashion designer Agnès B. reveals a taste for unusual American movies in a weeklong series of screenings sponsored by BAMcinématek. The program, which began on Monday, continues this weekend with Tod Browning's ''Freaks'' (1932), David Lynch's ''Lost Highway'' (1996) and John Waters's ''Pink Flamingos'' (1972). Those three treat audiences to the stories of homicidal circus sideshow performers, a musician who turns into a mechanic and a transvestite competing with everything she's got in a Filthiest People Alive contest. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Anita Gates) JOSEF VON STERNBERG RETROSPECTIVE (Through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's monthlong tribute to Sternberg (1894-1969), the Vienna-born director who played Svengali to Marlene Dietrich, ends this weekend with four films.

(Gates) LOOKING IN/LOOKING OUT: DOCUMENTARIES FROM SCANDINAVIA (Through Dec. 16) Scandinavia House's festival of documentaries from five countries begins on Wednesday. The first week's films are Margreth Olin's ''Raw Youth'' (2004), from Norway, which follows high school sophomores in Oslo preparing for exams, and Pirjo Honkasalo's ''Cinderella of Tallinn'' (1995), from Finland, a portrait of an Estonian woman who became rich by selling the Soviets' heavy metal leftovers. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL RETROSPECTIVE: 50 YEARS OF JANUS FILMS (Through Oct. 27) In conjunction with this year's New York Film Festival, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting a monthlong salute to Janus, the long-revered distributor of foreign films.

''Carmen Jones'' (1954) is the all-African-American musical based on Bizet's opera ''Carmen.'' ''Bonjour Tristesse'' (1957) is based on Françoise Sagan's novel about a spoiled French teenager. ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1953) is the romantic-triangle comedy that shocked sheltered 1950's audiences with risqué words like virgin. ''Die Jungfrau auf Dem Dach,'' Preminger's German-language version of ''The Moon Is Blue,'' will also be screened. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) STAR TREK: 40 YEARS OF FANDOM (Through April 15) The Museum of the Moving Image's exhibition celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first ''Star Trek'' television series includes 30 or so fan-produced films and a Columbus Day screening of ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (1982).

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. TREY ANASTASIO (Sunday and Monday) The breakup of Phish barely interrupted the schedule of the band's guitarist, singer and main songwriter, Trey Anastasio.

At 7 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-4300, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles) EEF BARZELAY (Tuesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache and regret with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' With Casey Dienel and Kelley McRae. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door.

Its new album, ''Crazy Itch Radio'' (XL), dips into 1970's funk and soul, Balkan brass bands, updated swing and even banjo picking over a house beat. Onstage it keeps people dancing. At 9 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, bowerypresents.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door.

(Kelefa Sanneh) GIPSY KINGS (Tomorrow) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. Part of the New York Gypsy Festival, with Romashka, Dorit and the Russian Gypsy dancer Julia Kulakova. At 8 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-5157, roxynyc.com or nygypsyfest.com; $35 and $40. (Pareles) GOMEZ (Tonight and tomorrow night) This British band emerged in the mid-1990's, the heyday of Britpop, with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its newest album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), it has veered into folkier realms, though it still plays with unusual precision and focus. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $27; tomorrow's show is sold out.

As it works its way to repeated climaxes, the music can feel like a glorious release or the last thrashings of a captured animal. At 9 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-6115; $15.

(Stephen Holden) MERCYME (Sunday) Like a number of Christian rock bands, this one is known for a kind of yearning modern rock that wouldn't sound out of place on a secular radio station; the band has a following that many secular acts probably envy.

(Sisario) PORCUPINE TREE WITH PROJECkT SIX FEATURING ROBERT FRIPP AND ADRIAN BELEW (Tonight) Progressive-rock -- with its suitelike songs, complex meters and epic ambitions -- lives on in Porcupine Tree.

(Pareles) RATATAT (Tonight) The two guitarists who make up Ratatat have one simple but sometimes charming idea. They plug away at 1970's-inspired riffs, creating atmospheric tracks that split the difference between minimalist post-rock and maximalist hard rock. At 9, Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; $20, cash only, at the door; free for members.

(Pareles) SOCIAL DISTORTION (Monday through Wednesday) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. With Supersuckers opening.

(Pareles) ROD STEWART (Monday) After making four albums of old pop standards, Rod Stewart is applying his voice to rock: not his own, but other people's tried-and-true material, with an emphasis on ballads. For those who can't make the show, it will be shown at theaters nationwide the same night. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $75.

(Holden) ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required.

(Holden) * TOOL/ISIS (Tonight and tomorrow night) A double bill of hard rock with progressive-rock tendencies. In Maynard James Keenen's songs for Tool, angst, outrage, righteousness and disgust translate into aching melodies with complex, pummeling riffs down below. The hard rock of Isis churns and seethes before it eventually erupts. . Tonight at 8, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $23 to $57.50. Tomorrow night at 8, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $42 to $56.50. (Pareles) TRIVIUM, THE SWORD (Tuesday) The hurtling double-bass-drum thrust and guttural vocals of thrash metal give way, now and then, to an actual melody in Trivium's latest songs. The Sword opens. At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $18. (Pareles) KT TUNSTALL (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Tunstall reaches back to the folk-pop of the 1960's and 70's, with a big, bluesy voice and, now and then, an echo machine that helps her do dizzying things with it. At 7:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25.25 in advance, $27.25 day of show. (Pareles) * WOLF EYES; JOHN WIESE; THURSTON MOORE AND PRURIENT (Tonight) An all-star lineup of noise-rock. The members of Wolf Eyes, from Michigan, once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise,'' and meant it: the group's rumbling, nightmarish clangor is in one sense a straightforward exposition of a kind of elemental rock artistry. The prolific John Wiese, from Los Angeles, has collaborated with pretty much everybody in this scene, including Thurston Moore, the Sonic Youth guitarist and art-rock figurehead. Tonight Mr. Moore plays with Prurient, a one-man noise machine from Providence, R.I. Also on the bill is Religious Knives. At 9, the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, thehookmusic.com; $10.

(Pareles) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. BALLIN' THE JACK (Sunday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's especially true on this one-night stand, which features music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen) ANDY BISKIN AND TRIO TRAGICO (Tonight) On his new album, ''Trio Tragico'' (Strudelmedia), Mr. Biskin presents a small chamber group consisting of himself on clarinet, Dave Ballou on trumpet and Drew Gress on bass. Their repertory ranges from melodic miniatures, by Mr. Biskin, to nearly open-form improvisation, collectively determined. At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) RICHARD BONA (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Bona, the Cameroonian bassist and vocalist, has an appealing new album, ''Tiki'' (Decca), that confirms his commitment to musical globalism. He leads a six-piece group that includes the trumpeter Taylor Haskins, the keyboardist Etienne Stadwijk and the drummer Ernesto Simpson. At 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street, at LaGuardia Place, West Village, (212) 477-8337, zincbar.com; cover, $5, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) MATT BREWER QUARTET (Tomorrow) The bassist Matt Brewer has lately distinguished himself in bands led by the saxophonist Greg Osby; this group features another adventurous saxophonist, Tony Malaby, along with Frank Locrasto on piano, and Rodney Green on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * PETER BRÖTZMANN AND HAN BENNINK (Tonight) Few modern saxophonists can sound as powerfully abrasive as Mr. Brötzmann, and few drummers can seem as convincingly unhinged as Mr. Bennink. Each is a pillar of the European free-improvising scene, and a touchstone for the rambunctious wing of the contemporary avant-garde. At 7:30 and 9, Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; $20; students, $10 (Chinen) RAY BROWN TRIBUTE BAND (Tonight through Sunday night) A tribute to Ray Brown, the quintessential jazz bassist, consisting of younger artists who had the chance to work with him: the singer Dee Dee Bridgewater, the pianist Benny Green, the drummer Greg Hutchinson and, slyly grinning in the hot seat, the bassist Christian McBride. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) STEPHAN CRUMP (Wednesday) As a bassist and composer, Mr. Crump avoids obvious routes but manages never to lose his way, as he demonstrates on his intimate new album, ''Rosetta'' (Papillon Sounds). He celebrates the album's release by regrouping the two sensitive guitarists it showcases, Liberty Ellman (on acoustic) and Jamie Fox (on electric). At 9:45 p.m., Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-1900, thecuttingroomnyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This series continues this weekend at Tonic with such sharp-minded trumpeters as Thomas Heberer (tonight) and David Weiss (tomorrow). Next week it moves to Cornelia Street Café, with up-and-comers like Bart Miltenberger (Tuesday), John McDonough (Wednesday) and Nate Wooley (Thursday). Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12 and $15.

Detailed festival information is at fontmusic.org. (Chinen) KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Kenny Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies toward blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics, and an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. His recent album on Nonesuch, ''Beyond the Wall'' was inspired by the ancient cultures of China and Africa. He'll revisit it with a band consisting of Benito Gonzalez on piano, Kris Funn on bass and Jamire Williams on drums. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) DAVID GILMORE (Monday) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sensibility. He is performing with the all-star group from his new album, ''Unified Presence'' (RKM): Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Christian McBride on bass, Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums and, as a special guest, the vocalist Claudia Acuña. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Wednesday and Thursday) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion next week with a five-night run replete with special guests. On Wednesday and Thursday, that means Bill Cosby, as host and M.C. (Through Oct. 15.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) JOHN HEBERT'S BYZANTINE MONKEY (Wednesday) This experimental ensemble features the original music and bass playing of John Hebert, along with the contributions of Tony Malaby and Michaël Attias, saxophonists, and Nasheet Waits, a drummer. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) GERRY HEMINGWAY/ELLERY ESKELIN DUO (Tomorrow) Texture outweighs tempo in Mr. Hemingway's drumming, and his compositions reveal a fruitful fascination with polytonality. Mr. Eskelin, a tenor saxophonist, has a predilection for expressive gruffness, but he tends to find the groove even in formless expanses. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; students, $8. (Chinen) FRANK KIMBROUGH (Tonight) Mr. Kimbrough is a thoughtful and harmonically literate pianist, with equal taste for melody and abstraction. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20.

(Chinen) TONY MALABY, WILLIAM PARKER, NASHEET WAITS (Sunday) A promising meeting of three accomplished yet restless improvisers, with experience both in and out of the avant-garde: Mr. Malaby, saxophonist; Mr. Parker, bassist; and Mr. Waits, drummer.

(Chinen) * BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Branford Marsalis leads one of the most athletic working bands in the jazz mainstream, a point of pride he playfully acknowledges with the locker-room photograph on the cover of his new album, ''Braggtown'' (Marsalis Music). The ensemble -- with Joey Calderazzo on piano, Eric Revis on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums -- doesn't work often in clubs, which makes this engagement all the more significant. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen) * BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Brad Mehldau recently renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard. The group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is slightly more pop-oriented, and its rhythmic tumble more pronounced. (Through Oct. 15.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PETE ROBBINS (Sunday) The choral music of the Italian Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo has recently provided inspiration for the creative energies of Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist. His ''Gesualdo Adaptations'' feature a modernistic ensemble of two saxophonists, two guitarists and an electric keyboard, along with bass and drums. At 8 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen) * KURT ROSENWINKEL QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Kurt Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has an airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. The two musicians are backed by Aaron Parks on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums. At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MATT WILSON QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Wilson, a mischievous and nimble drummer, leads a rugged quartet with the trumpeter Jon Sneider, the saxophonist Jeff Lederer and the bassist Martin Wind.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, the New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette) 'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller updates Donizetti's lively comic opera from a rustic Italian setting to a 1950's American diner in this New York City Opera production. The cast includes Anna Skibinsky as Adina, and Erin Morley as Giannetta (both making their company debuts), John Tessier as Nemorino, Paulo Szot as Belcore and Jan Opalach as Dulcamara. George Manahan conducts the New York City Opera orchestra in Donizetti's tuneful score. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'FAUST' (Tonight and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. Tonight at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Allan Kozinn) 'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow) Grand opera does not get much grander or more theatrical or more violent than this. The traditional production by the Metropolitan Opera stars Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina, with Marcello Giordani taking over as Enzo. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $42 to $375. (Bernard Holland) * 'IDOMENEO' (Tuesday) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' staged by the Metropolitan Opera. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. Other standouts in the cast include the exquisite soprano Dorothea Röschmann as the captured princess Ilia and the rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. James Levine conducts a refined account of a work he clearly loves. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's elegantly stylized 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Anthony Tommasini) 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its charmingly tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it continues its run of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' with a rotating cast. The quality varies and depends largely on who is singing that night, but the spirit is often there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) 'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up for this season, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Metropolitan Opera. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of the frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Franz Lehár operetta ''The Merry Widow.'' The production will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini) 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Sunday) The composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at the age of 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera, which has been a champion of this neglected work, has revived its 1975 production, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrow and Monday) Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairytale opera ''Die Zauberflöte,'' introduced in 2004, did not please everyone, including this critic. But overall it was an enormous hit with Met audiences. To me the production was so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine and cast took a back seat to the stage show. The conductor Scott Bergeson takes the podium for the Met's current revival. The promising cast includes Isabel Bayrakdarian as Pamina, Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno. Tomorrow at 1:30 and Monday at 7:30, the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied all the time. Tonight Katya Mihailova, a pianist; William Harvey, a violinist; and Chris Gross, a cellist, play piano trios by Haydn, Dvorak and Adolphus Hailstork. Tomorrow and Sunday another ensemble -- Naoko Tanaka, a violinist; Masao Kawasaki, a violist; Joseph Lee, a cellist; and Rita Sloan, a pianist -- play Mozart's Piano Quartet No. 1 (K. 478) and works for violin and piano by Mozart and Shostakovich. And on Thursday the pianist Hamish Milne plays Bach's Partita No. 4, Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109) and works by Medtner and Chopin. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Kozinn) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) To start its Carnegie Hall appearances in James Levine's third season as music director, the orchestra is performing the Viennese Schools, first and second, in two piano concertos, one by Beethoven (the fourth), one by Schoenberg. Both feature as soloist another conductor with a wide and ambitious range, Daniel Barenboim. Also on the program is the string-orchestra version of Schoenberg's ''Verklärte Nacht.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Midgette) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Thursday) If you think that the Chamber Music Society's usual home, Alice Tully Hall, is too big for this intimate repertory, here's a chance to hear the ensemble in closer confines. Stephen Taylor, the oboist; Jose Franch-Ballester, the clarinetist; Peter Kolkay, the bassoonist; Stewart Rose, the hornist; and Inon Barnatan, the pianist, recombine in various configurations to play the Francaix Divertissement, the Poulenc Trio and Beethoven's Quintet in E flat for Winds and Piano (Op. 16). At 6:45, the Rose Studio, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; sold out. (Kozinn) * VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tuesday and Thursday) In a surprising shift from his modern piano comfort zone, this thoughtful artist is performing all of Mozart's piano sonatas on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The five recitals are split between the New School and the Mannes College of Music. In the final two installments, Mr. Feltsman will play the Sonatas in F (K. 533), C (K. 545) and C minor (K. 457), and the Fantasia in C minor (K. 475), on Tuesday at Mannes; he will perform the Sonatas in B flat (K. 570) and D (K. 576), as well as the Fantasia in D minor (K. 385), the Rondo in D (K. 485) and the Adagio in B minor (K. 540) on Thursday at the New School.

(Kozinn) BEN HEPPNER/WENDY BRYN HARMER/CRAIG RUTENBERG (Thursday) For its recital series, the George London Foundation pairs established vocal stars with young recipients of the foundation's annual award. Pairing Ms. Harmer, a soprano, with Mr. Heppner, a popular tenor, has paid off: the event is already sold out. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue (36th Street), (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Midgette) THE JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Thursday) This excellent band of polished young musicians will show what they can do with Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A; Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, with Konstantin Soukhovetski as soloist; and Richard Strauss's Wiener Philharmoniker Fanfare. James DePriest, Juilliard's director of conducting and orchestral studies, leads the program. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, www.juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer) LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The orchestra's Beethoven cycle with Bernard Haitink begins with the Second and Third Symphonies and will continue through the week. If recordings are an indication, these should be honest, sturdy and ultimately winning performances. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $85. (Holland) LEON MCCAWLEY (Sunday) This British pianist is active across Europe, but has not yet been heard in recital in New York. He will perform a few signature pieces, including a suite by Hans Gál, an émigré Austrian composer whose complete piano works Mr. McCawley has recorded, and the K. 311 sonata by Mozart. (A complete sonata cycle is due out soon.) The program also includes Schubert's D. 537 sonata and some pieces by Rachmaninoff.

The lineup also includes the soprano Jessica Jones, the mezzo-sopranos Isabel Leonard and Kelley O'Connor, the baritone Ian Greenlaw, the tenor Philippe Castagner (all making their Philharmonic debuts) and the bass Kevin Deas. The second half of the program features Saint-Saëns's Symphony No. 3, ''Organ.'' The Philharmonic's organist, Kent Tritle, is the soloist. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org; $28 to $94. (Schweitzer) * ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) The Bach specialist Mary Dalton Greer conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the New York Baroque Soloists in ''Bach Dialogues for Soprano and Bass,'' the first of three programs in the ''Cantatas in Context'' series, now in its seventh season.

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $100. (Holland) DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN/GRAHAM JOHNSON (Thursday) In recital, American singers tend to want to show their versatility (''Look, Ma, I can sing in five languages!'') This fine German soprano is, by contrast, sticking to her home language with an all-Viennese program. She strays afield only with some of Schubert's Scottish songs -- including all three of ''Ellen's Gesänge,'' one of which is better known as ''Ave Maria.'' The program also includes a set of Mahler and Berg's ''Sieben frühe Lieder.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $42. (Midgette) PETER SERKIN (Wednesday) This enterprising and distinguished pianist mixes music by Bach and Toru Takemitsu in another of his mind-bending evenings of contrast.

(Anderson) LYON OPERA BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow night) In its only New York City-area performance this season, the Lyon company will perform two different programs featuring ballets by William Forsyth; the company director, Maguy Marin; and Sasha Waltz; with two views of Beethoven's Grosse Fugue in choreography by Ms. Marin and Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,' through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Roberta Smith) Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Jan 7. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Paint disports in the tiny crevices between the bars to give an effect of luminosity. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * the MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE, through Feb. 19. One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, this show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (See above) . (Smith) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Notwithstanding the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman) Galleries: Chelsea Ken Gonzales-Day In the process of researching a book called ''Lynching in the West: 1850-1935,'' this Los Angeles artist assembled an archive and made a discovery: in the more than 350 California lynchings he found records for, most of the victims were Latinos. His photographic show at Cue Foundation is an interpretive response to this fact, largely through altered historical photographs, in which the hanged figure is erased, and the spectators left intact. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, cueartfoundation.org, through Oct. 14. (Cotter) Dona Nelson The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter) * RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this young Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith) DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith) * SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented young artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size but also reveals it to be a Pandora's box of ideas. Max Ernst, Paul Outerbridge, Karen Kilimnik and Carol Bove are among the ghosts in these diminutive machines, which nonetheless run on their own steam. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 14. (Smith) Last Chance Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto This gallery has changed its location but not its smallness, which is important to its craft-based, private-feeling, nostalgic-utopian aesthetic. The work of Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto, from little watercolors to hand-size embroideries, exemplifies it. Little Cakes, Little Gallery, 625 East Sixth Street, Apartment 1B, East Village, littlecakes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) 'The Filipino Roots of Minimalism: Leo Valledor and Mario Yrisarry' We owe Mitchell Algus for yet another historical rescue with this show of two painters who had a strong New York moment decades ago, then disappeared. Based on what's here, their shared Filipino background was less important to their interesting, and unalike art than the fact that they were both born in the 1930's, were abstract painters in the city in the 1960's, and exhibited at the Park Place gallery, along with Sol Lewitt, Edwin Ruda, Robert Smithson and Mark di Suvero. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Suite 206, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * DANIEL LEFCOURT Against most odds, these beautifully made paintinglike configurations of strips of medium-density fiberboard painted black transcend their resemblance to the Minimalist get-me-out-of-painting paintings of the late 1960's. Their variety and needle-thin incised lines add layers of ideas about measurement, drawing and space, both real and illusionistic. They land squarely in the present, where abstraction is neither a dead horse nor a sacred quest, because they are primarily about looking. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3540; closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'Mapquest' Elena Sorokina organized this group show for the activist art Web site artwurl.org. Most of what's in the gallery, by individual artists and collectives, is graphics-oriented, information-intensive and, in the current ''interventionist'' way, obliquely polemical. The show continues on artwurl.org itself. Performance Space 122 Gallery, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249; closes on Monday. (Cotter) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer . Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous, Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman) SARAH OPPENHEIMER: 554-5251 In the latest labor-intensive, wall-piercing installation to treat the gallery space as a malleable object, portions of the white cube have been sliced open and seemingly formed into two enormous tubes. Part tunnel, part basket and mostly plywood, these cut through the space, revealing the storage area and windows normally hidden from view, and requiring some walking in a crouched position. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1077, ppowgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde -- collagists, collaborators and co-founders of the Booklyn Artists Alliance -- may or may not make money from their art, but for sure they make their art from money. Mr. Wagner works with green-and-white United States currency, Mr. Wilde with a rainbow of international tender. From tiny pieces of both they assemble intensely detailed pictures of staggering virtuosity, with Mr. Wilde specializing in cut-and-paste remakes of Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Smith) ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface. D C Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",4fd28d548eb7c8105d862726,14209

(Ben Brantley) 'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Buggé's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 362-0329. (Gates) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Spectacles 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30); closing tomorrow. The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Gates) 'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder) 'A CRAZY SOUND' The Italian avant-gardist Dario D'Ambrosi offers a jaunty, unexpectedly feel-good musical about the mentally ill (1:15). La MaMa's Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) It's bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Tuesday. (Isherwood) 'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates) * 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (John Rockwell) 'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000; closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder) * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) ' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Five prominent writers -- Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados, Roger Rosenblatt and Len Jenkin -- toss off short plays inspired by this Christmas poem, and the Flea Theater's troupe of young actors attack them with verve. The Swados piece, ''Holiday Movies,'' is as wacky as they come (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott) 'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future in which the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott) 'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Catsoulis) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis) 'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis) 'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis) 'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis) 'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott) 'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott) 'DÉJÀ VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis) * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic exposé of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott) * '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott) * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 2:12 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis) 'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Stephen Holden) * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott) 'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden) 'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. (Dargis) 'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis) 'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis) 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden) * 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) 'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly titled documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner, Björk, dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis) 'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott) 'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) This season's answer to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. (Holden) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) 'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden) 'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series THE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Jacques Rivette, the innovative French New Wave director, concludes this weekend with two features. Mr. Rivette's most recent film, ''The Story of Marie and Julien'' (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle Béart, plays tonight.

(Anita Gates) ESSENTIALLY WOODY (Tonight through Thursday) Film Forum's 28-film retrospective of Woody Allen's work continues this weekend with two double features. ''Broadway Danny Rose'' (1984), about small-time show business, and ''Radio Days'' (1987), an exercise in family nostalgia, play today and tomorrow. ''Sleeper'' (1973) and ''Bananas'' (1971), two of Mr. Allen's funniest, are the features on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. (Through Jan. 11.) 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $10.50 (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Today and tomorrow) Since February, the Museum of Modern Art has been honoring Jean Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with screenings of films that have won the prize that bears his name. The series winds up today and tomorrow with three features. Arnaud Desplechin's drama ''La Vie des Morts'' (1991), about a family's reaction to a suicide attempt, will be shown with Laurent Cantet's short about high school students, ''Tous à la Manif'' (1994). ''Maine-Océan'' (1986) is Jacques Rozier's comedy about train passengers. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates) VIVA PEDRO! RETURNS (Today through Wednesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting eight Pedro Almodóvar films over the holidays. This weekend's features include ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' (1988), Mr. Almodóvar's raucous portrait of the rejected and the high-strung; ''The Flower of My Secret'' (1995), about a romance novelist with creative and personal problems; and ''All About My Mother'' (1999), in which Penélope Cruz plays a pregnant nun. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10 (but $20 buys a pass to all eight movies). (Gates) FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-1967), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include ''Sayonara'' (1957), which employed a mix of American and Asian musical styles; ''Rebecca'' (1940), Hitchcock's haunting translation of the du Maurier romance; and ''Old Acquaintance'' (1943), starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as longtime friends and rivals. (Through Jan. 17.) Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. A-BONES, SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS (Sunday) Meaty, beaty, big and retro: the brawny sounds of gourmet 1960s-style garage-rock. The A-Bones' take on this sound is brusque and raw, while the Swingin' Neckbreakers play a more controlled version that recalls the Flamin' Groovies, the 1970s band that was perhaps the first (and best) in a long line of '60s garage revivalists. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) SANDRA BERNHARD (Tonight through Sunday) Expect outrageous comedy, but also expect some oddly dull music from Sandra Bernhard, like her colorless recent holiday song, ''Miracle of Lights,'' or her cover of the late-period Cheap Trick song ''The Flame,'' which is thankfully tucked into a hilarious routine about rescuing her daughter from a bad boyfriend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30, Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $45 tonight and tomorrow; $100 Sunday at 7:30, $150 at 10:30. (Sisario) BLACK LIPS (Tonight and Sunday) Sounding like a nightmarish variant of the 13th Floor Elevators or the Troggs, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of 1960s garage-rock that is deliberately damaged. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., at Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com. (Sisario) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tonight and Sunday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. Tonight at 9, with Kudu and DJ Hardedge, and Sunday at 9:30 p.m., at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 tonight; for Sunday, $55 in advance or $60 at the door. (Jon Pareles) ELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like ''Danger! High Voltage'' and ''Nuclear War'' (''on the dance floor''). With the Dansettes on Sunday. At 10 both nights, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15 tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Pareles) * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight through Sunday) The strongest incarnation so far of this singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Sunday night at 9, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum tonight and tomorrow night, $650 on Sunday. (Stephen Holden) RACHELLE GARNIEZ (Thursday) Ms. Garniez is a songwriter who plays accordion, which leads her to wrap her playful songs and hyperactive voice in country tunes, waltzes or wheezy ballads. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Pareles) GLASSJAW (Tonight) This tough-as-nails Long Island band was a big player in the dissonant, tantrum-prone punk subgenre sometimes called screamo or post-hardcore, which peaked in the early years of this decade. A revolving door of lineup changes kept the band from moving forward, but Glassjaw is now reportedly working on a new album. At 6:30, with This Is Hell and Crime in Stereo, at Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) GOV'T MULE (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes, this Southern-rock-meets-Led Zeppelin jam band plays three shows for New Year's weekend, with notable guests each night. Tonight is Los Lobos, the enduring Latino rock band from Los Angeles; tomorrow is the North Mississippi Allstars, whose blues-rock wanders into jam territory; and Sunday features Toots Hibbert, the Jamaican singer who, with his band the Maytals, helped shape reggae from the very beginning. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 9 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $40.50 to $63.50 tonight and tomorrow night; $55 to $79.50 on Sunday. (Sisario) * 'HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL: THE CONCERT' (Tonight and Sunday) Cynical parents might compare it to the Monkees. But what in the world could be wrong with ''I'm a Believer''? Or, for that matter, with ''Breaking Free,'' the PG-rated climax from ''High School Musical,'' the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack is the best-selling album of the year? Performing the songs from this tween ''Grease,'' to the accompaniment of many thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack. Tonight at 7, Sunday afternoon at 3, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; sold out tonight, $35.50 to $55.50 on Sunday.

At 10 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, saintatlarge.com; $90 in advance, $100 at the door. (Sisario) JAMES HUNTER (Tomorrow) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating with care and affection the smooth, slithery R&B of early-1960s American singers like Sam Cooke and Little Willie John. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario) JAPANTHER (Thursday) This Brooklyn avant-rock duo has bridged the gap between scruffy noise-punk and contemporary art: for the latest Whitney Biennial, the band collaborated with Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Laurent P. Berger and Tony Oursler on a live puppet opera called ''Don't Trust Anyone Over 30.'' But perhaps even more impressive, Japanther has also provided musical accompaniment for a synchronized-swimming performance. Anyone who has witnessed synchronized swimming knows that can't be easy. At 8 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. (Sisario) MOE (Tomorrow and Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacy interludes or the borderline of funk. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. Sunday at 9 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $52.50. (Pareles) REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) A New Orleans institution since the 1980s, the Rebirth Brass Band updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk. It doesn't need microphones, amplifiers or anything but breath and rhythm to make a crowd jump. At 11:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles) VERNON REID (Tonight) Long after his time as the lead guitarist of Living Colour, Mr. Reid continues to play in ways so weirdly innovative that he sometimes seems more magician than mere musician. Tonight he offers ''A Night of Pure Guitar'' with Rob Balducci and Dave Weiner. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario) THE SLIP (Sunday) New Year's Eve was made for jam bands, which are used to playing all night without exhausting themselves (or their audiences). The Slip, from Boston, plays a mild jazz fusion that veers into the abstract post-rock of Tortoise. With Meowskers. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $25. (Sisario) * PATTI SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) For the ninth year, Ms. Smith and her band ring in the new year with noise, poetry and rock 'n' roll. This event features a special milestone: tomorrow is Ms. Smith's 60th birthday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * SPOON (Tomorrow) Led by Britt Daniel, one of the best songwriters ever to get stuck with the meaningless appellation ''indie,'' Spoon, from Austin, Tex., accomplishes a lot with a little. Its tight, jabby songs, influenced equally by minimalist post-punk and sentimental white soul, are beguiling miniatures that seem to end just when you think you've figured them out. As a result, you must listen again and again and again. With Benjy Ferree, a rising singer-songwriter from Washington. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) THE SWORD (Tomorrow) Long live Black Sabbath. Or, at least, bands that sound an awful lot like them, such as the Sword, an Austin, Tex., group that seems to have most of what made Black Sabbath great. Fuzzy, decelerated blues-rock riffs? Check. Sasquatch tempo? Check. Songs about vague industrial-age catastrophes and medieval monsters? Check (''The Horned Goddess,'' ''Iron Swan''). Ozzy Osbourne? Well, no, even retro-rock has its limits. At 9 p.m., with Stinking Lizaveta and Motherboar, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) UNCLE MONK (Wednesday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- kind of like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. With Radio I-Ching and Who Put the Bad Mouth On Me? At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) * THE VIEW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Arctic Monkeys are so 2006. The next next wave of hyperactive British rock savants is the View, four teenagers from Dundee, Scotland, who play sharp, tuneful pop-punk that resembles that of the Arctic Monkeys. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., with the Diggs and Favourite Sons, at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) WHITE MAGIC (Thursday) Mira Billotte's songs in White Magic are both spartan and spooky, with simple piano figures underlying vocals that can be steady incantations or elaborate, multilayered rhapsodies. With Women and Children, and Legends. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

ABERCROMBIE, BYRON, GOMEZ AND WHITE (Thursday) The guitarist John Abercrombie, the clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Don Byron, the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Lenny White make up this all-star collective, which seems predisposed to lean toward the funky side.

(Nate Chinen) BALLIN' THE JACK (Thursday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's certainly true of this engagement, featuring music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8.

(Chinen) CHRIS BOTTI (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a sizable audience, as has his standard-laden repertory.

(Chinen) PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tonight through Sunday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

(Chinen) * DELFEAYO MARSALIS TRIBUTE TO ELVIN JONES (Tuesday through Thursday) A few months ago the trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis released ''Minions Dominion'' (Troubadour Jass), an album recorded in 2003 and featuring the unmistakable polyrhythmic pulse of the drummer Elvin Jones. Here Mr. Marsalis pays tribute to Mr. Jones, who died in 2004, with a band featuring his brother Jason Marsalis on drums and either Mark Shim (on Tuesday and Wednesday) or David Liebman (on Thursday) on tenor saxophone. (Through Jan. 7.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano. But at 79, he assuredly has an improvisational voice of his own; he also has a cult following, chiefly among his former students. He performs infrequently, but that's only one reason that this trio engagement is a noteworthy event. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) ONE FOR ALL (Sunday) The driving hard bop of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers provides a mission and a method for this strong sextet, which consists of the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the trumpeter Jim Rotondi, the trombonist Steve Davis, the pianist David Hazeltine, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $125. (Chinen) REUBEN RADDING 40th BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Tonight) Reuben Radding, an adventurous bassist and composer, celebrates a special occasion with a passel of improvising friends, including the multireedists Daniel Carter and Ned Rothenberg, the guitarists Elliott Sharp and Mary Halvorson, and the drummer Andrew Drury. At 8 and 10, Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. She performs here with two frequent foils: the guitarist Adam Levy and the clarinetist Doug Weiselman. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) DIANE SCHUUR WITH THE CARIBBEAN JAZZ PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) As on a recent album called ''Schuur Fire'' (Concord Picante), the singer Diane Schuur enjoys streamlined accompaniment from the vibraphonist Dave Samuels and his Caribbean Jazz Project. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30, and Sunday night at 8 and 11, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $45 tonight and tomorrow night, with a $10 minimum; $110 and $160 on Sunday, including dinner. (Chinen) TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE / PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tuesday) Two ambitious ensembles that combine spacious avant-gardism with the melodic punch of rock. Oblique is a sextet led by Mr. Sorey, a ferocious drummer, with ranks including Mr. Robbins on alto saxophone and clarinet. Centric, led by Mr. Robbins, also happens to include Mr. Sorey, along with other bright young players, like the trumpeter Jesse Neuman and the keyboardist Eliot Cardinaux. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings both virtuosity and restraint to the conventions of small-group hard bop; his group includes his wife, the cellist and vocalist Akua Dixon, as well as the pianist Ronnie Mathews, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Dion Parson. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen) BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON (Tuesday through Thursday) The alto saxophonist Bobby Watson formed his first version of Horizon more than 20 years ago, managing to iron a sharp new crease into the legacy of Jazz Messengers-inspired hard bop. His current iteration of the group, as heard on the 2004 album ''Horizon Reassembled'' (Palmetto), consists of Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. (Through Jan. 7.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) * JOHN ZORN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of open-minded participants; tomorrow's cast will include the violinist Mark Feldman, the cellist Okkyung Lee, the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and the drummer Matt Wilson. Then, on New Year's Eve, Mr. Zorn plays an early set at Tonic with the bassist and producer Bill Laswell and the drummer Guy Licata, among others. Tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $20.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread public interest in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score for ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Plácido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tonight through Sunday night) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now offered is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. At 7:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+, $125 for the New Year's Eve gala. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'THE MAGIC FLUTE' (Today through Tuesday, and Thursday) Julie Taymor's whimsical, puppet-filled production has gone even more child-friendly, abridged by the director into a 100-minute version with a new English text by J. D. McClatchy. But the Met hasn't skimped on the casts. Today Matthew Polenzani sings Tamino, and Nathan Gunn is a lively, entertaining Papageno; they will be joined tomorrow by the fantastic German bass René Pape as Sarastro. James Levine conducts today through Sunday, and Jens Georg Bachmann conducts on Tuesday and Thursday. Today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. A live high-definition telecast will be shown tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809, filmlinc.com; $18; $15 for children. (Schweitzer) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Monday and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. James Levine conducts a cast that also includes René Pape as Sarastro, Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Cornelia Götz as Queen of the Night. On Thursday Scott Bergeson conducts, and Lisa Milne is Pamina. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 to $375 tickets remain for Monday, and $15 to $175 for Thursday. (Schweitzer) Classical Music AMOR ARTIS (Sunday) Johannes Somary and his fine chamber orchestra and choir have made their New Year's Eve Bach concert a tradition over the past two decades. This performance, the 22nd installment, includes three Cantatas -- Nos. 137, 191 and 200 -- as well as the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 3 and 5. At 9 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-4513, amorartis.org; $40. (Allan Kozinn) ARTEK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument group offers one of the last celebrations of the waning Mozart year, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Enrico Gatti, an Italian violinist, leads the orchestra in ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' ''Serenata Notturno'' and arias from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Il Re Pastore,'' ''La Clemenza di Tito'' and others, with Jessica Tranzillo, a soprano; Barbara Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano; Drew Minter, a countertenor; and Philip Anderson, a tenor. The pianists Gwendolyn Toth, Artek's director, and Dongsok Shin, her husband, perform Mozart's Concerto for two fortepianos (K. 365). At 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, artekearlymusic.org; $35 and $20; $10 off for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Zubin Mehta returns to the Philharmonic next week. The opening work will be Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Mehta's old friend the violinist Pinchas Zukerman as soloist, followed after intermission by Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Mr. Mehta's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic has its defenders and detractors. But this Stravinsky score was a specialty of his back then. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Tommasini) VASSILY PRIMAKOV AND KONSTANTIN SOUKHOVETSKI (Sunday) These two young pianists from the former Soviet Union, both in their 20s, play an interesting program of Beethoven, Czerny, John Corigliano and Tchaikovsky. Arium offers a little food and drink, and visual art as well. At 4 p.m., Arium Center for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; sold out. (Bernard Holland) 'THE VERY LEAST OF P. D. Q. BACH' (Tuesday) Skewering the traditions of the classical music world is one thing; finding the comedic opportunities inherent in the music itself is another, and that is Peter Schickele's art. His canvas is the life and work of P. D. Q. Bach, the fictional ''last and least'' of J. S. Bach's progeny. With Mr. Schickele as guide and commentator, Xian Zhang will lead the New York Philharmonic in a program that includes the ''Desecration of the House'' Overture, the ''1712'' Overture, ''Eine Kleine Kiddiemusik,'' the Prelude to ''Einstein on the Fritz'' and a venerable P. D. Q. classic, the ''Pervertimento'' for bagpipes, bicycle, balloons and strings. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $30 to $90. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) The last three days of this vibrant company's annual City Center season, ending with a special New Year's Eve performance. Tonight at 8, tomorrow row at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org or nycitycenter.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell) Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Lots of men can wear tutus; point shoes are another matter. If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they are called, performing classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Claudia La Rocco) KWANZAA CELEBRATION: REGENERATION NIGHT (Tonight) Forces of Nature Dance Theater, a troupe dedicated to expressing balance, healing and harmony through movement, collaborates with Spirit Ensemble and Vy Higginsen's Gospel for Teens in a Kwanzaa event with Hazelle Goodman as host. At 7:30, the Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $12; $10 for groups. (Jack Anderson) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) The final three performances of the 2006 installment of George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker.'' It may have been hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to mention the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Tigers of Wrath: Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio) Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck) Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''Midi Disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith) * Noah Fischer, 'Rhetoric Machine' This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet mécanique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter) * CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith) * CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as ''Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.'' Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith) * 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures -- Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton -- look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter) Other Galleries * 'November' The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka's listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art's 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter) Last Chance * 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck) * Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125)' The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT' Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING' Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue's radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith) Museum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now' This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio) National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam, 1819-1865' This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio) Parrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters' Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. ''Chief Before Teepee,'' an abstract oil painting, and ''Two Wild Indians,'' a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel) 'Replanting the Community Garden' Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Brent, a professional landscape designer, contributes an ''Urban Air Scrubber,'' a closet-size smoker's lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it's a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum' Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) Paul McCarthy: 'Between Beauty and the Beast' Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy's signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In ''Masks'' (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of ''Dwarf Head'' (2000) borrow from Walt Disney's ''Snow White.'' Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy ZPark South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)",4fd279678eb7c8105d83cbd1,14510

Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. Broadway 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) *'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'APRIL'S SHOWER' (No rating, 98 minutes) A lighthearted comedy about the outing of a bride-to-be and her five-year relationship with her maid of honor. Though filled with sitcom-ready stereotypes, ''April's Shower'' presents a refreshingly volatile view of sexual orientation. As faces are slapped and partners are switched, the movie leaves you with the feeling that gay is good, but bi can be even better. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) 'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern) 'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott) 'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott) 'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Bohème'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott) 'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee) 'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott) * 'STATE OF FEAR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TERRORISM' (No rating, 94 minutes, in English and Spanish) Based on more than 16,000 testimonies to the Peruvian Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Pamela Yates's harrowing documentary chronicles the 20 years of terror between the rise of the Maoist leader Abimael Guzmán and his Shining Path guerrillas, and the November 2000 overthrow of President Alberto Fujimori's corrupt dictatorship. Together with ''The Montesinos Media Buy,'' seven minutes of surveillance video depicting the Fujimori regime's media bribery, ''State of Fear'' is a timely lesson on the hazards of choosing security over democracy. (Catsoulis) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manqué never develops any stamina. (Holden) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82). This weekend's film is ''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (1972), about a depressed fruit peddler in a loveless marriage. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771; $10.75.

(Gates) PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION (Through Feb. 6) A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. Tonight's films are ''Toy Story 2'' (1999) and two Oscar-winning shorts, ''Geri's Game'' (1997), about an old man playing chess, and ''For the Birds'' (2000), about a group of snobbish feathered friends. ''Monsters Inc.'' (2001) will be shown on Monday and Thursday. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ACT LOCAL HURRICANE BENEFIT (Sunday) The charity group Act Local presents an all-day benefit show for the Southern Arts Federation Emergency Relief Fund, which aids musicians affected by last year's hurricanes. More than 30 local musical acts are scheduled to perform, including the Wrens, Nada Surf, Estevez and Langhorne Slim. All Ages. 1 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra) AKRON/FAMILY, MI AND L'AU, WOODEN WAND (Tomorrow) This bill sandwiches the whispery Finland-based folk duo Mi and L'au between two weirder acts: the layered and deceptively melodic Akron/Family, a quiescent lo-fi quartet that explores the dark crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana, and Wooden Wand (a k a James Toth), who mixes modal guitars with mutters and yawps that suggest a Pentecostal drunk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra) BURNSIDE PROJECT (Tonight) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath. 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra) CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TRAMPLED BY TURTLES (Tomorrow) The 80's college-rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. The electric bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles opens. 10 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 8 and 10, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra) OLU DARA, RICHIE HAVENS (Monday) The cornetist Olu Dara leads a group that takes an amiable approach to a stream of good-time American music that runs from old jazz and blues to funk; he keeps audiences happy. An unswerving 60's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) THE ENGLISH BEAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dave Wakeling still performs under the name of his old Birmingham band, which in the 80's mastered a soulful version of British ska and had hits with songs like the jittery ''Mirror in the Bathroom.'' 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) MARK EITZEL (Tonight) The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints, with increasingly electronic beats of late. The sad-folk outfit Last Town Chorus also plays. 8:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra) GOLDEN FESTIVAL (Tonight and Tomorrow) Featuring the energetic Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band, which plays dance music in the Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Romany traditions, this two-day festival of regional Balkan dance and music begins with a program that will include John Parish, the Greek-Macedonian Kavala Band and the Scandinavian Loretta Kelley before a midnight Zlatne Uste show. Some of the more than 50 performers filling tomorrow's three performance spaces hail from places like Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia, but the bill also includes admirers from Norway, Iran and Louisiana.

(Sinagra) HARD-FI (Tuesday) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic arena punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) HUUN-HUUR-TU (Tomorrow) Cowboys from Tuva, where Siberia meets Mongolia, cultivate the technique of throat singing: producing a deep bass note and two or three harmonics above it, all at the same time. Tibetan monks use a similar technique for Buddhist chants. Huun-Huur-Tu uses the style for ancient herding songs and newer material. It is an eerie, riveting sound, like a growl linked to whistling winds, and it seems both raw and timeless. 8 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Pareles) JAZZANOVA (Sunday) Alexander Barck performs as an ambassador of Berlin's Jazzanova, an electronic music collective that has always placed an emphasis on groove over glitch. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, meatpacking district, (212) 645-5700; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. 7:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles) B. B. KING: TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING (Sunday) The bluesman B. B. King's falsetto vocal flips and vibrato guitar licks have been an indelible influence on the blues and rock traditions. He made his musical reputation in Memphis, which is also where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died. This Sunday, on the eve of Martin Luther King Day, he plays a show in the civil rights leader's honor. 7 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $35 to $100. (Sinagra) THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and Moog-like warps. It's the sound of postindustrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4224; free with R.S.V.P. at www.crashinin.com. (Sinagra) KOOL KEITH, SLUM VILLAGE (Tomorrow) The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Detroit's Slum Village also plays. 11:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) LYCAON PICTUS (Tomorrow) Aaron Diskin used to play with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' kinetic, stinging guitarist Nick Zinner, but Mr. Diskin's music for the synthesizer-bass-drum trio Lycaon Pictus is darker, recalling the apocalypse imagined by forerunners like Pere Ubu. 8 p.m., Kingsland Tavern, 244 Nassau Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-9883; $5. (Sinagra) PABLO MAYOR AND FOLKLORE URBANO, FORRÓ FOR ALL (Thursday) Pablo Mayor's Folklore Urbano gives Colombian folk some modern inflections. Rob Curto's Forró for All plays bouncy accordion-based party music from northeastern Brazil. 7:30 p.m., Makor Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; $12. (Sinagra) MI AND L'AU (Tonight) The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, reportedly moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra) ELIZABETH MITCHELL: YOU ARE MY FLOWER (Tomorrow) Like several indie-rockers, the soft-pop band Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton have turned to making kids' music lately. Their approach takes the form of reinterpreting classic folk songs. Here Ms. Mitchell plays and sings selections from that repertory. 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, (212) 864-5400; $14; members and children, $10; Just Kidding Club members, $5. (Sinagra) ALEC OUNSWORTH, PURE HORSEHAIR, MICHAEL LEVITON (Tomorrow) The frontman of the local rock band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah has a side project with members of Ida, Boss Tweed and Ill Ease. Also on the bill are Pure Horsehair (a k a Garrett Devoe), a fingerpicking folk-pop songwriter, and Michael Leviton, who plays sea shanties on the ukulele. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra) MIGUEL POVEDA WITH GIOVANNI HIDALGO (Thursday through Jan. 21) Th0e raspy drama of traditional flamenco singing arrives in a new generation with Miguel Poveda, an award-winning flamenco vocalist. He plays here with Giovanni Hidalgo, a percussionist who can make his conga drums crackle, slide, sing melodies and just about talk. 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Sinagra) THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Wednesday) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra) RYE COALITION (Tonight) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. Shelby also plays. 9:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $8. (Sinagra) SUFJAN STEVENS (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Coplandesque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $20 to $45 (sold out). (Sinagra) SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK (Sunday) Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this all-women a cappella group, which never forgets to leaven righteousness with pleasure. 2 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles) THE SYN (Tuesday) Back when the Who used to play the Marquee, the Syn used to open for them. One band member, Chris Squire, went on to become way more famous as the bassist with Yes. Forty years later, the Syn have re-formed to play their old proto-prog tunes and make new music as well. 7 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sinagra) KT TUNSTALL (Tuesday) A British singer nominated for a Mercury Prize, KT Tunstall takes breaks from her preferred 70's folk-pop to explore dance music and quieter, rootsier styles. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE WRENS (Tonight) These noise-artist rockers write about life in their home state of New Jersey, but not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk. With their routinely understated, meditative albums and their intense, up-tempo live shows, they offer two different responses to suburban tensions. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 (sold out).(Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) 'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. (Barbara Fasano fills in for Ms. Kole tomorrow.) 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden) * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. CLAUDIA ACUÑA (Tonight and Thursday) Ms. Acuña is a vocalist attracted to lyrical high drama and guided by the pulse and passion of her native Chile; she performs a solo show tonight, and shares a Thursday bill with Marta Topferova, another singer enamored of Latin music, but with origins in Eastern Europe. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King piqued jazz purists a few years ago with a spate of irreverent cover tunes; ''Suspicious Activity?'' (Columbia), their most recent album, shifted the focus to epic-sounding originals. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) KENNY GARRETT QUARTET/HIROMI (Tuesday through Jan. 22) Mr. Garrett is a forceful and propulsive personality on the alto saxophone; Hiromi is a diminutive yet dynamic presence on electric keyboards and piano. Both artists favor tight ensembles, although that commonality doesn't quite explain this odd double bill. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER (Sunday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, and Mr. Miller, the pianist, share a postbop language especially rooted in the blues; their duo performance comes under the banner of chamber jazz, but the music they concoct should make the term seem quaint. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. Mr. Miller also plays with his trio tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.

(Chinen) ROBERT HURST GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Hurst, a bassist with a deep and earthy tone, has long been a resourceful small-group composer, as well as an underappreciated bandleader. This weekend he applies those talents to two distinct crews: a next-generation quartet with the pianist Robert Glasper, the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the drummer Karriem Riggins (tonight); and a quintet of somewhat more experienced peers, like the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (tomorrow). 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) INGRID JENSEN QUINTET (Thursday) A fiery postbop trumpeter with a book of smart original tunes, Ms. Jensen performs here with the same rhythm section featured on her new album, ''At Sea'' (ArtistShare): the guitarist Lage Lund, the keyboardist Geoffrey Keezer, the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Jon Wikan. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tomorrow; Tuesday through Jan. 21) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a continuing deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, which is never more pronounced than when she performs with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tomorrow at 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Tuesday through Thursday at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) RE:ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Through Sunday) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias, and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man; he appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) TIM RIES AND THE ROLLING STONES PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Ries, a tenor and soprano saxophonist who has toured extensively with the rock 'n' roll institution mentioned here, rearranges a handful of its signature hits, smoothing many of the rough edges but also uncovering ample opportunities for improvisation. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist with a cool tone and a thoughtfully off-kilter sensibility, leads an ensemble consisting of Sam Sadigursky on tenor and soprano saxophones, Eliot Cardinaux on keyboards, Mike Gamble on guitar, Thomas Morgan on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $5.

(Chinen) KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases postbop ideals without abandoning the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; in this ensemble, he plays alongside the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, the guitarist Mike Moreno, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Yunior Terry, the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.(Chinen) MICHAEL WEISS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Weiss, a pianist with extensive sideman credits in the jazz mainstream, turns the spotlight toward his own compositions, including a commissioned suite called ''Three Doors''; his band includes Steve Wilson on alto and soprano saxophones, Ugonna Okegwo on bass, Daniel Sadownick on percussion and Adam Cruz on drums. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * RANDY WESTON AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall that of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions; this concert, dubbed ''The Spirit of Afrika,'' will commemorate the year of his 80th birthday with an assortment of friends, including the saxophonists Billy Harper and Cecil Payne, the trombonist Benny Powell, the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the conga virtuoso Candido. 8 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, 1 University Place, at DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651ARTS.org; $35, $45 and $80. (Chinen) REGGIE WORKMAN'S BREW (Tuesday) Mr. Workman's bass playing has always evinced a graceful athleticism and an attunement to texture; here he organizes a setting that should emphasize both traits, in a trio with Miya Masaoka on koto and Gerry Hemingway on percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. AVALON STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) Since its founding in 1995 at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Connecticut, this dynamic ensemble has won several notable competitions and secured coveted residencies, most recently at Indiana University. Tomorrow it gives the second of two intriguing programs exploring the frontiers of Romanticism.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35; $25 for students.

(Midgette) BRONX OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $15 to $30. (Allan Kozinn) CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) You might think that the Juilliard School had enough to handle with its ambitious musical celebration of its centenary, not to mention the annual Focus festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school is also presenting this series of free concerts of diverse chamber works performed by accomplished student musicians. There are piano trios by Ives and Shostakovich; works by Beethoven and Dvorak will jostle against works by Stravinsky and Morton Feldman. For those who like large-scale chamber pieces, there is Mendelssohn's rousing Octet. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. at Paul Hall at the Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street; Wednesday at 1 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406.

(Kozinn) 'COMPOSER=PERFORMER' (Thursday) Adventurous programming has been part of Symphony Space's calendar on and off over the years, but lately the hall seems intent on joining the Miller Theater as a new-music center on the Upper West Side. In ''Composer=Performer,'' it offers music written and performed by Todd Reynolds, one of the violinists in the quartet Ethel; Joan La Barbara, who is known for her range-stretching vocalizing; and John King, a guitarist and violinist who will offer a preview of a score he is writing for the Mannheim Ballet. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $16 for students and 65+.

In collaboration with the Library of Congress, Mr. Hampson is embarking on an 11-city American tour with a program that covers American song from the 1700's to the present. There will be psalms, hymns, folk songs, cowboy songs, spirituals and art songs -- not just by familiar composers like Bernstein and Copland but also by influential (and overlooked) composers like Arthur Farwell and Elinor Remick Warren. Wolfram Rieger will be the pianist. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72.(Tommasini) MANHATTAN STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) Thirty-five years old and going strong, this group is presenting a complete cycle of the Shostakovich quartets during its residency at St. Bart's.

(Midgette) MUSIC OFF THE WALLS (Sunday) ''Manufactured Landscapes,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of Edward Burtynsky's photographs, ends on Sunday, but just as these pictures of industrial sites are about to be packed up, musicians from the Brooklyn Philharmonic will offer a program of chamber works that also evoke landscapes, natural and industrial. The composers are Debussy, Varèse, Cage, John Luther Adams and Theodore Wiprud. 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 488-5913; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

The concert's title, ''Mozart's Autumn Years,'' is a bit odd for a composer who died at 35, but you get the idea: included are late works, including the Symphony No. 41 and the incomparably beautiful Clarinet Concerto, with Karl Herman as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75.

Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Ken Johnson) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from Southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. On the secular side but equally dazzling are two portraits of men from a long series of male visages done by Antonello in the 1460's and 70's. The intensely human play of expression on the subjects' faces makes a connection with the viewer that few artists before or since have been able to achieve. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck) MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Holland Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street * SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) * ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith) 'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix in most cases a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) PHILIPPE MAZAUD: STAGE LIGHT Roaming the countryside in rural Idaho and Nevada, Mr. Mazaud shoots provocative, sometimes spooky night scenes using only found light. Following a current tendency to make pictures that don't tell tales, but move viewers to create their own, he presents scenarios like a small house on a snowy street with two bright windows giving evidence of occupancy, illumined by a streetlight near an old-fashioned telephone pole strung with taut, crisscrossing wires. It could be the setting for domestic felicity or mayhem. Foley, 527 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Jan. 21. (Glueck) * LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Bryan Savitz The inventive Mr. Savitz presents a forest of fake tree trunks and objects, like a hammock and a pipe organ, made mainly of scratch-off lottery tickets. A wild group show in the rear gallery called ''Waiting for the Barbarians'' includes a Beaux-Arts-style pornographic vision of flying cowgirls painted by Nicola Verlato; a horribly abused anthropomorphic pig in a sculptural tableau by Fernando Mastrangelo; a large, Dalí-esque ballpoint pen drawing by Tim Maxwell; and a big, semi-abstract digital photograph by Chris Rodrigues, apparently illustrating an otherworldly epic. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 268-1520, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson) * JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith) ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson) Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson) Other Galleries 'I woke up in a strange place ' The Postmodern mindscape gets a good workout in a show that includes Samantha Simpson's finely drawn allegorical monkeys; Simon Keenleyside's small paintings of gloomily magical birch forests; a puddle of vomit made of pearlescent pink sequins by Craig Fisher; Edward del Rosario's precise paintings of tiny, oddly dressed people; and a Neo- Pop installation representing an old world hunting-lodge interior by Ryan Humphrey. Moti Hasson, 330 West 38th Street, (212) 268-4444, through Jan. 21. (Johnson) Last Chance Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow.(Johnson) Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, closing Sunday. (718) 638-5000. (Johnson) Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)",4fd2670d8eb7c8105d81bdf3,14625

Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric socialite relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' Opens Feb. 22.

Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 353-0303. 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' Opens Feb. 21. MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Beginning Tuesday, Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'A BITTER TASTE' When an academic gets too close to one of his case studies, his mistake haunts him in this twisty, acid drama about repression, friendship and the intersection between sex and power (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 'ELLIOT, A SOLDIER'S FUGUE' True to its title, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue'' is composed like a fugue, with several narrative strands playing in point and counterpoint around one theme: a soldier's experience of war. The play, by Quiara Alegria Hudes, traces the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family, and without invoking current politics, manages to indict the war in Iraq (1:10). 45 Below at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'GIRL IN HEAT' Nelson Avidon's predictable dramedy about Joseph, a randy lawyer, and Marilyn, a flirtatious office temp, is salvaged to some extent by the play's two performers. As their characters reveal themselves uneasily, Mr. Avidon and Cheryl Leibert make the struggle believable (1:20). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444. (Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'BURIED CHILD' Sam Shepard's dark and sometimes funny portrait of a dysfunctional Midwestern family doesn't translate successfully into the bright colors of Norman Rockwell Americana. The director, Cyndy A. Marion, and her White Horse Theater Company did much better a year ago with a production of another Shepard play about family, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' which was full of mystery and emotion (2:40). The American Theater of Actors, Sargent Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Stevens) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'COWBOY DEL AMOR' (No rating, 86 minutes, in English and Spanish) For 16 years, Ivan Thompson, a self-styled 'Cowboy Cupid,' has been supporting himself by helping disenchanted American men meet hopeful Mexican women. Directed by Michèle Ohayon with an attentive ear for the regressive attitudes beneath the humor, ''Cowboy Del Amor'' is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) 'A GOOD WOMAN' (R, 93 minutes) This loose adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1892 comedy, ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' moves it out of the drawing room, and out of England to the Italian Riviera in 1930, casting as its leads two American actors (Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson) who have no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee: fatal mistakes all. (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School in Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILM IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalán film continues this weekend with screenings including Pere Portabella's ''Warsaw Bridge'' (1989), three parallel stories set all over Barcelona; Agusti Villaronga's ''In a Glass Cage'' (1987), a drama about depravity that the American director John Waters has said he found shocking; and ''Fausto 5.0'' (2001), the Catalán theater group La Fura dels Baus's interpretation of Goethe's ''Faust.''

(Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year.

(Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''Effi Briest'' (1974), starring Hanna Schygulla as a 19th-century teenager who marries an older man. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Sunday) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. The series ends this weekend with five films, including Stephen Frears's 1985 comic drama, ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' selected by Gene Seymour, about two young men who go into business together and fall in love; and Roko Belic's ''Genghis Blues'' (1999), selected by Lisa Schwarzbaum, a documentary about a blind American blues musician who teaches himself throat-singing. 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. The first weekend's films include ''Don't Forget You're Going to Die'' (1995), Xavier Beauvois's tale of a student who is told he's not long for this world; ''The Gardener'' (1980), Jean-Pierre Sentier's absurdist fairy tale set at a factory; and Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 New Wave classic, ''Breathless.'' 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

(Jon Pareles) BISHOP ALLEN (Tonight) The indie pop outfit Bishop Allen is in the spotlight lately for its frontman Justin Rice's leading-man turn in Andrew Bujalski's film ''Mutual Appreciation.'' In it he plays to a receptive but sparse Brooklyn crowd. His own band has a slightly larger following. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Laura Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7:30, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra) CELEBRATION (Thursday) Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. This bill also includes Hong Kong and Baby Shakes. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) ELECTRIC SIX, SHE WANTS REVENGE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Monday) The Detroit garage rockers Electric Six broke out of the pack by virtue of the singer Dick Valentine's mania on songs like ''Danger! High Voltage.'' The band's new album, ''Senor Smoke,'' is less compelling, but features the timely apocalyptic rumination ''Jimmy Carter.'' She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (both days sold out); Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) FEIST, JASON COLLETT, MATES OF STATE (Tonight) The Canadian bohemian Leslie Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones. Jason Collett makes loud music with the Broken Social Scene collective, and softer music on his own. The indie-pop duo Mates of State open. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 (sold out).

He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences.

(Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Tuesday) In the final week of its Mozart series, the Philharmonic offers the three last symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. True, it's about as uninventive as programming can be, but Lorin Maazel has proved a surprising Mozart conductor lately, and during the first two weeks of this minifestival, the Philharmonic players have been at their zestiest. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Kozinn) PACIFICA QUARTET (Sunday) This young ensemble, based at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, gave a memorable performance at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, and last year released a solid, richly played traversal of the Mendelssohn string quartets on the Cedille label. It returns for one of Lincoln Center's early morning concerts, with Mendelssohn's Quartet in E flat and Tchaikovsky's Quartet in D. 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500; $20. (Kozinn) STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Daniel Barenboim reminds New York that he has an orchestra other than the Chicago Symphony. Conducting Germany's oldest orchestra, which he has led for more than a decade, he celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart, with two programs, each with two symphonies and a piano concerto in E-flat. Tomorrow's concerto is for two pianos; joining Mr. Barenboim will be Radu Lupu. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38 to $130. (Midgette) ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) The Orchestra of St. Luke's may be the most protean group in town. Here its members appear in various chamber combinations for works by Mozart, Debussy, Chopin and Schoenberg. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Eichler) 'VOICES OF LIGHT' (Thursday) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and her execution at the stake. His texts draw on the Bible, Joan's letters, the works of Hildegard of Bingen and other medieval churchwomen, and ''The Vices of Women,'' a 13th-century misogynistic ballad; his music pivots between the medieval world and ours. During a screening of the film, it is to be performed live by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8 p.m., World Financial Center, West Street, South of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Feb. 19) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tuesday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Feb. 19 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) * RONALD K.

(Dunning) * GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' (Through Feb. 19.) 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15.

Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. (Through Feb. 19.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.(Erika Kinetz) HEATHER KRAVAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) What promises to be a lively, internationally flavored double bill, with a three-year, long-distance collaboration between Heather Kravas from New York and Antonija Livingstone from Montreal by way of Berlin, and a duet from PO.V.S., a dance collective from Moscow. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20. (Rockwell) METRO MOVEMENT PROJECT (Tonight and tomorrow night) In ''Modern Dance: Primitive Lights,'' dance by choreographers including Meg Brooker, Claire Elizabeth Barratt, Mark Lamb, Wendy Blum and Vong Phrommala will be presented in four programs, all performed in candlelight in a church setting, to live music and the spoken word. 7 and 9, Metro Baptist Church, 410 West 40th Street, Clinton, (917) 279-1941; $15; $7 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * THE NETA DANCE COMPANY A.W.A.R.D. SHOW (Sunday) This free monthly performance series organized and produced by the choreographer Neta Pulvermacher began in January and runs until May. It's a great idea -- each event presents work by four emerging or midcareer choreographers, then opens up discussion between the artists and the audience. Later everyone has a drink. Melinda Ring, Pele Bauch, Barbara Duffy and the wonderful Keigwin & Company are on the lineup, and Thomas DeFrantz will moderate the discussion. Call first -- the Joyce SoHo had to turn people away last time. 7 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org. (Sulcas) NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tomorrow) Choreography by Miro Magloire, the company's director, and Deborah Lohse and Constantine Baecher will be performed by dancers including Deborah Wingert. 8 p.m., City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smartix.com; $15; $10 for students with ID. and ages 65+ (Dunning) NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL 2006 (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) The city's annual celebration of all things Flamenco continues into its second week tomorrow night with the guitarist Vicente Amigo and an ensemble that includes the dancer Rafael Campallo. A gala on Wednesday night lines up some of flamenco's big guns, including the legendary Manolo Marin and Soledad Barrio, often seen in New York with Noche Flamenca. On Thursday, the Nuevo Ballet Español shows flamenco in a more contemporary guise -- a slightly doubtful enterprise -- featuring the wonderful Lola Greco. Various locations; for information: (212) 545-7536 or www.worldmusicinstitute.org/wmical/Main.asp (Sulcas) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) This 12-year-old festival has a noteworthy lineup over its second week. WilliamsWorks, a new troupe directed by a former New York City Ballet dancer, Todd Williams, gives its final performances this weekend (tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.), and the Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 18 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) * STARS OF THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) Cheesy but usually amusing and sometimes thrilling, these potpourris of dancers from hither and yon, performing to recorded music and offering sometimes challenging choreography but mostly flashy showpieces, are always worth a visit. This year the galaxy, many returning from previous galas, includes Irina Dvorovenko and her husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, from American Ballet Theater; Sofiane Sylve from the New York City Ballet; Svetlana Lunkina and Sergei Filin from the Bolshoi Ballet; Andrian Fadeyev from the Kirov Ballet; Mathilde Froustey and Emmanuel Thibault from the Paris Opera Ballet; Lucia Lacarra and Cyril Pierre from the Munich Ballet; Pilar Alvarez and Claudio Hoffmann from Tango Metropolis Argentina; and Desmond Richardson from Complexions. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500; $20 to $150. (Rockwell) THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) This year's Pow-Wow, the company's 31st, includes dances, stories and traditional music from the Iroquois and American Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Southwest, the Plains and the Arctic regions. (Repeated next weekend.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 and www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10. Matinees: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanied by a ticketholding adult. (Dunning) THE WALDEN COMPANY (Sunday) A new musical, ''All is Full of Love,'' by the choreographer Josh Walden, is based on the narrative of ''On the Town,'' but set to the music of Bjork. The one-time performance (presumably Mr. Walden is hoping for more) partly benefits Dancers Responding to AIDS. 8 p.m., Theater at St. Clements, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or TheaterMania.com; $39.90 to $81.50 (includes preshow reception). (Sulcas) * REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. (Through Feb. 18 and Feb. 22 to 25.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639(Johnson) Galleries: Uptown * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through Feb. 18. (Cotter) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'NOW' As a pendant to the photographer's survey at the Museum of Modern art, this show focuses on images of the land and outbuildings on his upstate farm, with special attention to the seasonal changes and akimbo branches of numerous apple trees. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Molly Davies This expansive show features major works from three decades by a veteran avant-gardist film and video maker. Ranging from near-abstraction to dreamlike allegory, the video installations of Ms. Davies call to mind artists as various as Gary Hill and Bill Viola. Some involve collaboration with musicians and dancers, and the esteemed poet Anne Carson stars in a sensuous and stately three-screen production from 2002 called ''Desire.'' Zone, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) Wu Jian'an: 'Daydreams' Trained in the art of paper cutting, this young Chinese artist scissors swirling, wonderfully intricate and fantastic compositions of figures, body parts and animals from single large sheets of white paper. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 414-1169, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'It's a Beautiful Day' Sweet but with an acid center, this group show includes Mie Yim's smudgy painting of stuffed animals in an overripe landscape; Charlene Liu's pale watercolor vision of wrecked cars in an overgrown valley; Satoru Eguchi's architectural photographs cut into lacy patterns; Margaret Lee's watercolor pictures of rock formations with graffiti carved into them; Saeko Takagi's pastel-colored paintings of wan, blond models; Misaki Kawai's funky, storytelling marine sculptures; and Koji Shimizu's sculpture in the form of climbing equipment for cats. ISE Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana,: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation ofrecent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) Last Chance MARIA MAGDALENA CAMPOS-PONS: backyard dreams See this show for the large, gorgeously colored multiphoto works in which drawing, painting and photography merge with intimations of the female, otherness and a distinctly tropical locale. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'DAVID HAMMONS: THE UNAUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 81/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: a homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit.

(Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676; closes Sunday.

ABDULLAH IBRAHIM,2007-07-27,"ABDULLAH IBRAHIM Last September the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim presided over the premiere of the Cape Town Jazz Orchestra, an ensemble officially sponsored by South Africa's Department of Arts and Culture. For Mr. Ibrahim, above, the event was personally as well as historically significant. Born in a Cape Town ghetto in 1934 -- and, before his conversion to Islam, widely known as Dollar Brand -- Mr. Ibrahim left home in the mid-1970s because of apartheid and other political pressures. (Another consideration was the safety and education of his two children with the jazz singer Sathima Bea Benjamin; their daughter, Tsidi Ibrahim, is the rapper known as Jean Grae.) Since Mr. Ibrahim's return to Cape Town in the early '90s, an act of reclamation as well as a sign of faith, he has been celebrated not only as a pioneer of South African jazz but also as a cultural eminence, precisely the sort of elder statesman to lead a national jazz orchestra. Thankfully his style hasn't puffed up or stiffened, judging by the most recent recorded evidence. ''African Magic'' is a generous-spirited trio album, by turns sprightly and serene, released in 2002 on the German label Enja. (Like Mr. Ibrahim's previous two albums, the live trio release ''Cape Town Revisited'' and the chamber-symphonic ''African Suite,'' it's available in North America through Justin Time Records.)",4fd260018eb7c8105d80fed7,370

WHAT'S ON TONIGHT,2007-02-06,"8 P.M. (13) FORGOTTEN GENIUS -- The grandson of Alabama slaves, Percy Julian earned acclaim in the 1930's for his work in organic chemistry, including discovering a way to turn soybeans into synthetic steroids on an industrial scale - which in turn helped make drugs like cortisone available to millions. And yet, his accomplishments as an industrialist, self-made millionaire, humanitarian and civil rights pioneer have been largely overlooked. This ''Nova'' episode uses re-enactments, starring Ruben Santiago-Hudson (above) and based on family archives and interviews with colleagues and relatives, to tell the story of Julian, who broke the color barrier in American science more than a decade before Jackie Robinson did the same in baseball. 8 P.M.

The episode has echoes in modern New York State politics. 10 P.M.

But while Ellington basked in the limelight of center stage, Strayhorn (above) led a more discreet existence as a gay man in the 40's and 50's, fighting to maintain his artistic and personal integrity while challenging prejudice.

The A Train Turns 75,2007-09-10,"Seventy-five years ago this morning, the new Eighth Avenue subway line -- now known as the A train -- opened to the public. The city was in the depths of the Depression and Herbert C. Hoover was in his final months in the White House, but the opening of a major new West Side subway line drew thousands of curious spectators.A front-page article, ""New Subway Meets Rush-Hour Demands,"" in the Sept. 11, 1932, issue of The Times, carried these subheadlines, noting that the first day went largely smoothly, but not without delay: ""Morning Crowds Handles With Dispatch -- Express Trains Comfortably Filled.

The Glory Of Their Songbook,2007-07-28,"The novelist and critic Wilfrid Sheed begins ''The House That George Built,'' his impassioned history of American songwriting in the first half of the 20th century, with a grand assertion. Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers collectively more than doubled the world's supply of singable tunes, he declares. This work ''constitutes far and away our greatest contribution to the world's art supply in the so-called American century.'' Wow! That's laying it on the line. Then he pretends to demolish his own argument by admitting that a literature consisting ''entirely of epigrams and haiku, or at most sonnets,'' has obvious limitations. But he still refuses to take it back. ''What's wrong with being hungry again?'' he asks. Aren't Oscar Wilde's one-liners better than his plays?",4fd25d908eb7c8105d80c5b9,990

Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than that of a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES' The trick to refashioning beloved children's books for the stage is to keep both the spirit and the story largely intact. In this, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford -- a musical-theater partnership of five decades' standing, who have moved from their hit ''I'm Getting My Act Together'' to the American Girl demographic -- have largely succeeded. This breezy, upbeat musical avoids slickness and gets the job done, and is nicely cast into the bargain (1:30). The Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'EXITS AND ENTRANCES' Athol Fugard casts a tender glance back at an actor whose dedication to theater helped spark his own in this warm if insubstantial stage memoir. Morlan Higgins capably excavates the emotional core of a role that might have seemed generic, playing an aging gay actor reckoning with the end of an up-and-down career. William Dennis Hurley plays the Fugard stand-in (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE COLOR OF FLESH' Joel Gross's intriguing play features impeccable performances by Amanda Jones, Samantha Ives and Jonathan Kells Phillips as the three corners of a triangle of love and friendship caught up in the French Revolution. It's no ordinary triangle: Ms. Jones plays Marie Antoinette, and Ms. Ives the real portraitist who often painted her (1:30). The 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 254-9533. (Genzlinger) * 'THE NIBROC TRILOGY' ''Last Train to Nibroc,'' ''See Rock City'' and ''Gulf View Drive'' make no mention of 19th-century Russian intellectuals but they do signal the arrival of a talented American playwright, Arlene Hutton. Set in Kentucky and Florida, between the beginning of World War II and the early 1950s, the plays track the life of a young couple whose individual ambitions conflict; they also clash with the goals of a changing American society. Straightforward and heartfelt, but never treacly, the works stand out in a cold, postmodern universe. Try ''See Rock City'' if you have time for only one (1:25, 1:30 and 1:55). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' on the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS' Jack Cummings III directs a respectable if reverential revival of William Inge's last major play. Seeking to access the poetry in Inge's homely tale of troubled lives in the Midwest in the 1920s, he can't quite hide its fundamentally prosaic qualities. Still, this Transport Group production gives audiences a chance to encounter a rarely seen drama from Broadway's heyday (2:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Moore) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'SERENDIB' David Zellnik's play about a group of scientists observing monkeys in Sri Lanka tackles questions about masculinity and social dominance within a framework that is too cute by half. That said, Mr. Zellnik seems to have more on his mind than many young playwrights (1:55). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 247-4982; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noël Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'TROPHY WIFE' Honky-tonk piano music and flickering film credits on a screen behind the stage set the tone for this slender period piece about a young woman who marries a wealthy older man to help her family's financial difficulties. The plot is taken from a short story by Chekhov, but it works fine in the 1920s milieu to which Mary Fulham and Terry Waldo, who wrote and performs the music, have transposed it; Mr. Waldo has also provided a veritable cornucopia of songs, to which Sharon Ann Farrell, as the ingénue, can at least do justice. But the piece, which seems a bouncy entertainment, turns out to want to stress its darker side; its abrupt ending leaves you hanging, wondering if, to make its point, the whole tone might have been a little less frothy (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C., 74 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis) 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'DREAMING LHASA' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Tibetan and English) This documentary from Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam is about a Tibetan-American documentary-maker named Karma (Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso), who is making a movie about Tibetans who fled persecution by the Chinese and settled in Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama's exile headquarters in northern India. The movie is filled with heartbreaking moments, . but the central story, about the relationship between Karma and an ex-monk named Dhondup (Jampa Kalsang), can't help feeling contrived. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'FIREHOUSE DOG' (PG, 111 minutes) When a pampered Hollywood pooch trades his movie-star lifestyle for a rundown firehouse, it's not long before he is saving a father-son relationship and tracking down a serial arsonist. Yet the movie's wittiest moment -- a canine parody of Dudley Moore's first glimpse of Bo Derek in ''10'' -- will be appreciated only by parents, and in trying to straddle both age groups, ''Firehouse Dog'' proves decidedly less nimble than its furry star. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'THE GLAMOROUS LIFE OF SACHIKO HANAI' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Japanese) A wayward bullet turns a hooker into a brainiac in this Japanese clutter of soft-core political parody, hard-core narrative nonsense, breezy sexism and penny-ante surrealism. (Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than the entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) 'THE HOLY MOUNTAIN' (No rating, 114 minutes, in Spanish) A scandal when first released, Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 movie -- a follow-up to his midnight landmark ''El Topo'' -- is a dazzling, rambling, often incoherent satire on consumerism, militarism and the exploitation of third world cultures by the west. The free-associative narrative follows a Christ-like thief through a series of surreal tableaus; the mission ends with a postmodern punch line that suggests that movies are drugs too, and the revolution can't happen until we kick our habits. (Seitz) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'PATHFINDER' (R, 100 minutes) It's all grunting, all goring in this witless period flick about some Norsemen of the apocalypse come to wreak bloody ruin in the New World. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) * 'ROCK THE BELLS' (No rating, 103 minutes) Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly's lively documentary follows the independent music promoter Chang Weisberg as he struggles to reunite the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan for a 2004 hip-hop concert. Capturing onstage and off with equal energy, the movie is a fascinating glimpse of a dreamer and a music culture that has always depended on them. (Catsoulis) 'SLOW BURN' (R, 93 minutes) There's not a line of dialogue that doesn't sound squeezed from a grade-C ''Law & Order'' imitator affecting a bogus inner-city street cred. (Holden) 'THE TV SET' (R, 87 minutes) Jake Kasdan's knowing satire of network television sends up the neuroses of writers and the ruthlessness of executives with minimal exaggeration. Nothing in this story of a writer (David Duchovny) pursuing his dream project seems implausible, which is less a limitation on the movie's comedy than it is its source. (Scott) 'VOICE OF A MURDERER' (No rating, 122 minutes, in Korean) The unpredictable Korean director Park Jin-pyo returns to the docudrama form with this fictionalized account of the unsolved 1991 kidnapping and killing of a 9-year-old boy. Filmed relentlessly from the point of view of the distraught parents (Sol Kyung-gu and Kim Nam-joo), the movie unfolds in endless, repetitive scenes of parental hysteria punctuated by phone calls from the shadowy abductor. By the 44th day and the umpteenth call, it's déjà vu all over again. (Catsoulis) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) Film Series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER SING-ALONG (Tonight) The IFC Center tries to get a little ''Rocky Horror'' action going by sponsoring a midnight screening of this cult television show's celebrated all-singing, all-dancing episode. Audience participation is strongly encouraged. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Dave Kehr) * COMMITMENT AND GRACE: THE FILMS OF CARLOS SAURA (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Saura is, of course, one of Spain's great film masters. But for those who love dance, he will always be an artist who spoke vivid new truths about Spanish dancing and the relationship between film and dance. This tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center covers 50 years of his work, with ''Blood Wedding'' and ''Sevillanas'' on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m., and ''Carmen'' on Thursday at 1 p.m. (Through May 3.) Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $11; $7 for students with ID and for 65+ at weekday screenings before 6 p.m.; $40 for a series pass for eight films. (Jennifer Dunning) INDIA NOW (Sunday through Thursday) Nine new features and two short films from India, in a series co-sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art and the Indo-American Arts Council. On the opening night the director Rahul Dholakia will introduce his controversial feature ''Parzania,'' a fictionalized account of the Gujarat riots of 2002. Other highlights include Arindam Mitra's ''Shoonya'' (Monday), an adaptation of T. S. Eliot's ''Murder in the Cathedral'' transposed to the world of Indian cricket, and ''Kaalpurush'' (''Memories in the Mist''), a new work by the Bengali filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta (Wednesday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Thursday) This Japanese band describes its style as ''extreme trip music,'' which basically means big, sloppy, psychedelic noise jams. It doesn't necessarily mean peasant frocks and long wizard's robes, but Acid Mothers Temple usually has plenty of those too. With Mammatus and Alasehoutek. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario) ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tomorrow) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid demonstration of being the world's happiest show-business couple. With Melba Moore. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; $45 to $65. (Stephen Holden) * BASEMENT BHANGRA (Tonight) For 10 years Rekha Malhotra, better known as DJ Rekha, has been leading this dance party at the downtown club S.O.B.'s, introducing legions of New Yorkers to the musky sound of bhangra, which melds Punjabi folk melodies with reggae and house-rocking electronic beats. Her efforts have been instrumental in popularizing the style in America, and she celebrates the milestone with an all-star anniversary show at the Hammerstein Ballroom, which should feel about 100 times bigger than S.O.B.'s but just as hot. Guests include Panjabi MC (whose song with Jay-Z, ''Beware of the Boys,'' is bhangra's biggest hit), Dhol Foundation and Bikram Singh. At 9 p.m., 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $35 to $100. (Sisario) BRAND NEW (Sunday) Not all emo goes the way of smirky punk-pop or sentimental singalongs. This excellent Long Island band plies dense, angry tangles of guitar and opaque lyrics of spiritual crisis, a cross between Pink Floyd and Nirvana. With Kevin Devine and the Manchester Orchestra. At 7 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) THE BUNKER (Tonight) Honking saxophones and screeching guitars were the best-known musical residents of Tonic, the Lower East side club that closed last week. But Tonic was also an important home for avant-garde electronica. The Bunker, Tonic's long-running late-night techno party, is moving to a new club without missing a single week. Tonight it opens at the Luna Lounge, another former Lower East Side boîte, which is now in Brooklyn. Besides the resident D.J.'s, Spinoza and Derek Plaslaiko, tonight features Bodycode, a noisemaker based in Portugual who is also known as Portable (and as Alan Abrahams). At midnight, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, lunalounge.com; $10. (Sisario) CLIPSE (Thursday) Comeback stories in rap are rare and sweet. In 2002 this Virginia duo rose to the Top 10 with sly rhymes about the cocaine trade and brutally minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then Clipse struggled in music-industry purgatory but triumphed with ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), another cold, lean and virtuosic exercise that was one of last year's best hip-hop albums. With Monica and Jovan Dais. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30. (Sisario) * JARVIS COCKER (Sunday and Monday) Carrying on the wittily misanthropic vignette style he perfected in his 1990s Britpop band, Pulp, Mr. Cocker, now 43, has returned with a solo album, ''Jarvis'' (Rough Trade). Without his former band, he is just as caustic but seems to have turned into a studio tinkerer, sampling the Righteous Brothers and Tommy James. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $32 in advance, $35 at the door (sold out on Monday). (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make swirling and surrealistic dramas out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Tez and the Girls of Karen Black. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $20. (Sisario) CONSTANTINES, TIM FITE (Thursday) Constantines is a feedback-worshiping Canadian band in the neo-MC5 mold: the bigger their guitar chords, the higher their fists fly. Tim Fite is harder to pin down. A lo-fi lone wolf from Brooklyn, he is somewhere between folk and hip-hop, and with his latest album, ''Over the Counter Culture'' -- a harsh rap indictment of consumerism and the American dream of selling out, which he offers free on his Web site (timfite.com) -- he has made himself into a cultural gadfly. At 8:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) * DEERHUNTER (Thursday) Recalling Spacemen 3, this Atlanta quintet plays loose, sprawling psychedelia that grows from sweet guitar and vocal melodies into patterns that seem both florid and evil. With First Nation and Pterodactyl. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) DIMMU BORGIR (Thursday) Dimmu Borgir is a Norwegian black-metal band: black as in dark and dismal, with haunted-house keyboard arpeggios and vocals rendered in an electronically processed monster growl. It's good for a shudder; few kinds of fans are as deeply into their scene as those who attend these shows, and the band doesn't come to the United States often. With Unearth, DevilDriver and Kataklysm. At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Ben Ratliff) * DNTEL (Wednesday) As he did in the Postal Service, his project with Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Jimmy Tamborello -- who has been recording under the name Dntel for a decade or more -- gracefully joins stutters of electronic noise and soft, pensive melodies. His latest, ''Dumb Luck'' (Sub Pop), features collaborations with indie royalty like Bright Eyes, Jenny Lewis and Grizzly Bear, which means that you might be hearing this gurgly, not-quite-innocuous music, like the Postal Service, on late-night bar playlists for years to come. At 10 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; free. (Sisario) * FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE (Tuesday) Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne earned their seats in the songwriting pantheon with a fluent power-pop classicism and songs that celebrate beta males and bridge-and-tunnel quotidiana (and, in the case of their 2003 hit, ''Stacy's Mom,'' teenage fantasies of older women.) Their new album, ''Traffic and Weather'' (Virgin), is full of familiar Fountains of Wayne-isms, with Beatlesesque chord progressions and stories of love encumbered by competition for taxis. With Robbers on High Street. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) * FRATELLIS (Thursday) Like Sweet and Slade before it, this Scottish trio is not afraid to be both tough and silly, employing bubblegum shout-alongs in its stompy, completely catchy hard-rock tunes. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) KRISTIN HERSH (Wednesday) Through the 1980s and '90s Ms. Hersh led Throwing Muses, the textbook college rock band, whose songs set turbulent and free-associative psychodramas to twisting guitar lines. Motherhood and experience have softened her music somewhat, but she remains a provocative songwriter, and her voice has aged into an expressive, sensual rasp. For this show her band will be augmented by a string section. With Dolorean. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) TAYLOR HICKS (Tonight) ''American Idol'' has sent many singers into the shark tank of Top 40 radio, but this smoky-voiced Alabama crooner, who has more in common with Michael McDonald than with Kelly Clarkson, heads in the direction of buttery soul. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $36 to $62. (Sisario) HOT CHIP (Tonight) With wobbly electronic rhythms and a strong command of the drippy, semi-ironic disco ballad, this English group plays wistful but still snarky dance music. Get too lost in the beats and you'll miss gags like the oh-so-art-rock countdown of nonsense words in descending size (''S-E-X-I-N-G, C-A-S-I-O, P-O-K-E''). With Tussle. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * JOHN LEGEND, CORINNE BAILEY RAE (Sunday and Monday) A five-time Grammy winner, John Legend has the right to be a little cocky. But on his second album, ''Once Again'' (Sony), he plays the gentleman -- for the most part, anyway. Channeling the most tasteful of '70s R&B, he permits himself the slightest racy double-entendre, telling his lady that ''love hurts sometimes when you do it right.'' In a sweet, tissue-thin voice, Corinne Bailey Rae sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' Sunday at 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; Monday at 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com. Both sold out. (Sisario) DAVE MATTHEWS AND TIM REYNOLDS (Sunday) The jam-band frog prince plays with an old guitar buddy whose style leans toward world-fusion. Expect long solos and inside jokes. At 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $75. (Sisario) LOREENA McKENNITT (Tonight) On ''An Ancient Muse'' (Verve), her first album in nine years, this Canadian singer explored her Celtic heritage in depth, from the British Isles to Turkey and along the Silk Road of Central Asia. And what did she find? Pretty much what she already knew: that with the help of some gossamer major-chord swells and reverberant, Enya-like vocals, any sound can be incorporated into the New Age fantasy of Celtic music. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $75. (Sisario) ERIN McKEOWN (Tonight) A smiley sprite whose knack for wordplay and light touch on the guitar have sometimes evoked Tin Pan Alley, Ms. McKeown took the plunge in her new album, ''Sing You Sinners'' (Nettwerk), recording 12 nuggets by Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Fats Waller and others (along with one by herself). If her voice is not quite up to the subtleties of wit the songs demand, her joy of discovery is sincere. With John Southworth. At 7:30, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario) NOISETTES (Monday) Conjuring the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and X-Ray Spex, this London band, led by the throaty and uninhibited Shingai Shoniwa, plays grimy, muscular punk-funk punctuated with lighter touches of something like vaudeville. With Looker and Cities on Fire. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) RICKY SKAGGS AND BRUCE HORNSBY (Tuesday) One of the most virtuosic musicians in bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs sends his fingers flying in a blur over mandolin, guitar and fiddle. He performs with Bruce Hornsby, whose years playing with the Grateful Dead have made him a more versatile and playful musician. The two have a new, untitled album that is maybe a little too versatile and playful: it includes a cornball version of Rick James's ''Super Freak.'' At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $50 and $60. (Sisario) Keely Smith (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) This ''queen of swing,'' as she has been nicknamed, may be the last surviving top-of-the-line entertainer from the Rat Pack era of Las Vegas. She is still in reasonably good voice. (Through April 28.) At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight and tomorrow night, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 cover tonight and tomorrow night, $65 and $100 Tuesday through Thursday. (Holden) PATTI SMITH (Tuesday) With ''Twelve'' (Columbia), a new album in which Ms. Smith covers the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana -- whose ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' gets an eccentric, bluegrass-tinged interpretation -- she and her band play three separate shows at the Bowery Ballroom on Tuesday night; tickets to each performance include a copy of the CD. At 6, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * RICHARD SWIFT, DAVID VANDERVELDE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Retro-pop can easily go the way of mere imitation, but these singers have found ways to evoke their heroes without being entirely defined by them. Richard Swift's cynical gloss on piano-driven cabaret-rock adds a taste of vinegar to Harry Nilsson. David Vandervelde, from Chicago, has the thin whine and androgynous swagger of T. Rex down pat, but also wisely pursues his gift for the elegiac folk-rock ballad. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. Sunday at 10 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733, pianosnyc.com; $12. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. BUFFALO COLLISION (Monday) Free improvisation is the working method for this collective, made up of the saxophonist Tim Berne, the violist Mat Maneri, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the drummer David King. As the name implies, results will be concussive at times, and maybe a bit hairy (in a good way). At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; $8 for students.

At 8:30 p.m., Roulette, 20 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 219-8242, roulette.org; $15; $10 for students. (Chinen) OLU DARA (Tuesday) Before he was known as the father of the rapper Nas, Mr. Dara was a trumpeter, guitarist and singer who infused New York avant-gardism with Mississippi twang. At 8 p.m., Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, Ext. 264, studiomuseum.org; $20; $15 in advance and for students; $12 for members. (Chinen) PAQUITO D'RIVERA'S JAZZ CHAMBER TRIO / EDMAR CASTANEDA TRIO (Thursday) The saxophonist and clarinetist Paquito D'Rivera explores a hybrid of jazz and chamber music in his group with Alon Yavnai on piano and Dana Leong on cello. The harpist Edmar Castaneda shares the bill with his working trio, which has a separate engagement on Monday night at 7:30 and 9:30 at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $15. Thursday at 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door . (Chinen) DIGITAL PRIMITIVES (Wednesday) The multireedist Assif Tsahar, the multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore and the percussionist Chad Taylor make up this experimental ensemble, which released an album of the same title last year. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; donation, $5. (Chinen) MIKE DILLON'S GO-GO JUNGLE (Tonight) Mike Dillon is a vibraphonist whose caffeinated approach to rhythm finds a suitable outlet in a funk-inspired jam band he calls the Go-Go Jungle. Sharing the bill are two similarly inclined bands, Licorice and the Bomb Squad. At 8, Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; cover, $12. (Chinen) SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A powerful and searching saxophonist, Sonny Fortune leads a group with Michael Cochrane on piano, Chip Jackson on bass and Steve Johns on drums. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) AL FOSTER QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The well-traveled drummer Al Foster has a lithe touch, ideal for modern jazz and more than suitable for funk; his band consists of the tenor saxophonist Eli Degibri, the pianist Kevin Hays and the bassist Doug Weiss. (Through April 29.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * FREQUENCY/ ANGELICA SANCHEZ TRIO (Sunday) Frequency is a Chicago-based ensemble consisting of the saxophonist and clarinetist Edward Wilkerson, the flutist Nicole Mitchell, the bassist Harrison Bankhead and the drummer Avreeayl Ra; its self-titled debut, released last year on the Thrill Jockey label, pairs textural experimentation with a slippery sense of swing. That stylistic negotiation is likely to resurface in a later set with Angelica Sanchez on piano, Tony Malaby on saxophone and Tom Rainey on drums. At 7 and 9 p.m., Jimmy's, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006, freestylejazz.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) MIKE GAMBLE'S MULTI METEORCHESTRA (Tonight) The guitarist Mike Gamble goes for density and velocity in this confab of nearly a dozen energetic young players. At 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)789-2762, tealoungeny.com; donation, $5. (Chinen) THE GANG FONT, FEAT. INTERLOPER (Tomorrow and Sunday) David King, the intensely propulsive drummer for Happy Apple and the Bad Plus, formed this Minneapolis-centered group with the bassist Greg Norton, a former member of the influential post-punk band Hüsker Dü. Adding to the prog-rock churn are Craig Taborn, on keyboards, and Erik Fratzke (of Happy Apple), on guitar. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Ridgewood, Queens, toddpnyc.com; cover, $8. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) DAVID GILMORE QUINTET (Tomorrow) David Gilmore favors a clean guitar tone, but his playing tends toward rhythmic convolution; his dynamic band includes Marcus Strickland on tenor saxophone and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; $10 for members. (Chinen) * HUMAN FEEL (Tomorrow) This reunited confab -- Chris Speed and Andrew D'Angelo on reeds, Jim Black on drums and Kurt Rosenwinkel on guitar -- has a smartly enigmatic new album called ''Galore'' (Skirl), its first in a decade. Its strength lies in an ideal of interconnectedness, and a tonal palette partly informed by underground rock. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5.

Tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766, sistasplace.org; cover, $25 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Chinen) THE LEGENDS OF BLUE NOTE (Thursday) The celebrated hard boppers from the 1960s Blue Note roster -- like Lee Morgan and Horace Silver -- provide a promising repertory foundation for this concert, featuring new arrangements for the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Through April 28.) At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) MAHAVISHNU PROJECT (Tomorrow) This single-minded repertory project, led by the percussionist Gregg Bendian, boldly apprehends the fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. As on its new Cuneiform release, the group involves a total of 11 musicians here, performing all the material from the 1975 album ''Visions of the Emerald Beyond.'' At 9 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, near Columbus Avenue, (212) 601-1000, mahavishnuproject.com; cover, $15. (Chinen) RON MILES /JENNY SCHEINMAN (Monday) Mr. Miles is a trumpeter with a dual attraction to sunlight and shadow, as he demonstrated on ''Stone/Blossom,'' a double album issued last year. He performs an early set with his band, and then joins Ms. Scheinman, a thoughtful violinist and frequent collaborator, in a set of her own. At 7 and 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10 a set. (Chinen) * CHARLES MINGUS: EPITAPH (Wednesday) Charles Mingus never saw a full performance of ''Epitaph,'' his epic orchestral composition; its premiere at Lincoln Center in 1989, came a decade after his death. That concert's conductor, Gunther Schuller, resuscitates the work here with a 30-piece orchestra; he also includes ''Inquisition,'' a recently discovered movement that has never been performed. Among the accomplished musicians in the ensemble is Christian McBride, filling Mingus's formidable bass chair. At 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)721-6500, jalc.org; $45. (Chinen) BEN MONDER (Thursday) In the hands of Mr. Monder, the electric guitar is a coloristic instrument first and foremost.

(Chinen) * DINO SALUZZI AND ANJA LECHNER (Tuesday) ''Ojos Negros'' (ECM) is a sparse and often haunting new album by Mr. Saluzzi, an Argentine bandoneón player, and Ms. Lechner, a German cellist; tango feeds into its mood, but so do jazz and some mournful strains of the European classical tradition. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 tomorrow. (Chinen) SAMBA JAZZ & MUSIC OF JOBIM (Tuesday through Thursday) A cosmopolitan Brazilian-jazz ensemble consisting of the pianist Helio Alves, the drummer Duduka da Fonseca, the trumpeter Claudio Roditi and the bassist Eddie Gomez.

(Chinen) STILL LIFE WITH COMMENTATOR (Tomorrow) The brazen theatricality of the modern news cycle fuels this collaboration between the pianist and composer Vijay Iyer and the poet Mike Ladd, originally presented at Brooklyn Academy of Music in December. The work is scaled back here but still features Pamela Z and Guillermo Brown on vocals, Okkyung Lee on cello and Liberty Ellman on guitar. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) * JOHN ZORN (Thursday) A couple months ago Columbia University presented the iconoclastic composer John Zorn with its William Schuman Award, a distinction of lifetime-achievement proportions. Mr. Zorn now presents selections from his fathomless oeuvre at the school's Miller Theater, including chamber works, Masada miniatures and ''Cobra,'' his celebrated game piece. At 7:30 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $15. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Thursday) This production conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of, notably, the captivating mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. But some major changes are coming this week. The emerging American tenor Lawrence Brownlee makes his Met debut as Count Almaviva, and the hardy German baritone Russell Braun sings Figaro. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'La Finta Giardiniera' (Wednesday) Singers from the Juilliard Opera Center present a staged production of Mozart's first mature opera buffa, which he wrote at 18. The cast includes Erin Morley as the Marchioness. Jay Lesenger directs, and Gary Thor Wedow conducts the Juilliard Orchestra. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, juilliard.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'FLAVIO' (Tomorrow) Candy pink and candy green set the tone for Chas Rader-Shieber's antic production of this opera, which consists of arias nestled side by side, bright and sweet as a box of fondants. Making company debuts are Katherine Rohrer, a light mezzo with a nice tone; Gerald Thompson, a promising but sometimes wild countertenor; and the conductor William Lacey, who led a strong, lithe performance on opening night. David Walker was fine as the foppish, foolish king of the title. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette) * 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Though its auditorium is too big for Handel, the Metropolitan Opera makes this work come alive, thanks to exceptional Handel singers. The countertenor David Daniels excels in the daunting title role, and the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson makes a vocally exquisite Cleopatra. Patricia Bardon, a rich-toned Irish mezzo-soprano, brings lyrical elegance to the role of Cornelia. Harry Bicket conducts stylishly. (On Tuesday the countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, who has been singing Tolomeo, takes over the title role; Danielle de Niese sings Cleopatra; and Jill Grove sings Cornelia.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $375 tickets remaining for tomorrow; $15 to $175 for Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'L'ITALIANA IN LONDRA' (Wednesday) Rossini's Italian girl got to Algiers; Cimarosa's, a generation earlier, made it only as far as London, but both were in pursuit of their beloveds. Cimarosa's opera is this year's little-known offering in the pleasingly offbeat canon of the Manhattan School of Music. Steven Mosteller conducts; Albert Sherman directs. At 8 p.m., Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'Madama Butterfly' (Tonight and Sunday) Paul Kellogg's administration at New York City Opera ends along with the spring season in these last two performances of this Puccini crowd-pleaser. Shu-Ying Li and Christopher Jackson head the cast in a minimalist production by Mark Lamos. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $93 remaining tonight, sold out on Sunday. (Bernard Holland) 'MANON LESCAUT' (Tonight through Sunday) Because of its difficulties, this early masterpiece by Puccini probably does not appear in production as often as the music merits. There are two long and demanding lead roles, crowd scenes, intimate scenes and a teeming orchestra score. The adventurous Dicapo Opera Theater is presenting a production by Michael Capasso this weekend, conducted by Pacien Mazzagatti, with rotating leads in the main roles of the impulsive Manon and her lover Des Grieux. It should be interesting to experience the opera in the company's intimate theater. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tonight and Monday night) The Broadway stage director Jack O'Brien has taken on two trilogies at Lincoln Center in the same year. First was Tom Stoppard's ''Coast of Utopia,'' and now he has moved on to Puccini's trilogy of dissimilar one-acters, in which he makes his debut tonight at the Met. The cast includes Salvatore Licitra, Barbara Frittoli and the inimitable Stephanie Blythe. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175 remaining tonight; sold out on Monday. (Midgette) 'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) For spectacle and big music, the Franco Zeffirelli production of Puccini's final opera, at the Met, is hard to beat. For compelling leads, you might have to look elsewhere. Erika Sunnegardh has replaced the shaky Andrea Gruber in the lead, joining Richard Margison (who does at least have the vocal heft for the role). Liping Zhang, an acclaimed Covent Garden Butterfly, has taken over as Liù, and Marco Armiliato, whose conducting seems increasingly wishy-washy this year, leads the orchestra. But spectacle and size are evidently enough to keep tickets selling briskly. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tomorrow; $100 to $175 for Wednesday. (Midgette) Classical Music * ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC (Thursday) Richard Egarr, the harpsichordist and conductor, was recently appointed Christopher Hogwood's successor as music director of the Academy of Ancient Music. Mr. Egarr will lead the period-instrument orchestra in three of Handel's six Concerti Grossi (Op. 3), which he recently recorded on Harmonia Mundi in warm, polished and dignified performances. The Carnegie program also includes Telemann's ''Water Music'' Suite in C and Handel's ''Water Music'' Suite in G. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Schweitzer) ELAINE ALVAREZ (Sunday) The Marilyn Horne Foundation presents its final ''On Wings of Song'' recital of the season. In her enticing program, this Cuban-American soprano explores the feminine mystique through songs inspired by the Swedish folk character Ingelill, a young maiden who drowns herself out of despair over a lost love. She will sing songs by Stenhammar, Sibelius, Liszt, Strauss and Bo Linde. John Churchwell is the accompanist. At 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, stbarts.org; $20; $15 for 65+; free for students. (Tommasini) * EMANUEL AX and EDGAR MEYER (Tonight) Mingling Bach and bluegrass is standard operating procedure for Edgar Meyer, the double-bassist for whom crossover is not a marketing ploy but a natural mode of being. Plenty of mingling takes place on this program, performed with the pianist Emanuel Ax. At one end of the spectrum are Bach and Haydn, arranged for the players' respective instruments; at the other are New York premieres of works by Mr. Meyer; Bright Sheng, the acclaimed Chinese composer; and the mandolin player Chris Thile, a former prodigy and an artist rapidly becoming as diverse as Mr. Meyer himself. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 and $54. (Midgette) BENJAMIN BAGBY (Sunday) Relying on hefty research and a bit of inspired guesswork, Mr. Bagby offers his re-creation of the ancient Bardic tradition in dramatic performances of ''Beowulf.'' At 1 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290, metmuseum.org; $35. (Allan Kozinn) * BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Stefan Asbury, a conductor who has done superb work leading new-music programs at Tanglewood, steps onto the Brooklyn Philharmonic podium to lead Julia Wolfe's ''My Beautiful Scream,'' performed with the Kronos Quartet; Vaughan Williams's ''Fantasia on the Theme of Thomas Tallis''; and Holst's ''Planets.'' At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $20 to $60. (Kozinn) CHANTICLEER (Thursday) This all-male vocal ensemble will give the premiere of its latest commission, ''And on Earth, Peace: A Chanticleer Mass,'' for which five diverse composers each contributed a movement. The American composer Douglas J. Cuomo wrote the Kyrie; the Turkish-American composer Kamran Ince wrote the Gloria section to a Sufi text; Michael McGlynn, who is Irish, contributed the Agnus Dei; Ivan Moody, a Briton, wrote the Sanctus; and the Israeli-American composer Shulamit Ran wrote the Credo. At 8 p.m., Temple of Dendur, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $70. (Schweitzer) * COMPOSER PORTRAIT: KIMMO HAKOLA (Tuesday) The Miller Theater's Composer Portraits is a kind of stealth series, since the concerts spotlight not only a composer, but also a performing ensemble. The composer, in this case, is the energetic Kimmo Hakola, whose music is getting its first large-scale treatment in New York; the ensemble is Present Music, an enterprising new-music group based in Milwaukee, conducted by Kevin Stalheim, which commissioned one of the works on the program. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Midgette) * EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) Frederick Renz leads his period-instrument chamber orchestra in an all-Haydn program that includes three symphonies -- No. 26 (''Lamentatione''), No. 30 (''Alleluia'') and No. 83 (''La Poule'') -- as well as a Concerto for Two Flutes and a Divertimento for Winds. At 8 p.m., St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40; $20 for students. (Kozinn) * QUINN KELSEY (Tonight) Born and raised in Honolulu, this baritone has been making his name in the vocal music and opera worlds. A recipient of a career grant from the Richard Tucker Foundation, Mr. Kelsey will sing works by Handel, Brahms, Finzi and Mussorgsky with the pianist Tamara Sanikidze. The event is presented by Carnegie Hall and the Marilyn Horne Foundation. At 7:30, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $34. (Tommasini) KREMERATA BALTICA (Monday) Gidon Kremer's eclectic chamber band offers some of its specialties, from Beethoven (the Grosse Fuge) and Schumann (a violin version of the Cello Concerto) to Korngold (the Symphonic Serenade) and Piazzolla (''Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas''). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Kozinn) * MIDORI (Tuesday) This adventurous violinist and champion of contemporary music offers the New York premiere of Einojuhani Rautavaara's ''Lost Landscapes.'' She commissioned the work in 2005 and performed its world premiere in Munich last year with the pianist Robert McDonald, who accompanies her here. The program also includes Beethoven's ''Spring'' Sonata, Hindemith's Sonata in E flat and Strauss's Sonata in E flat.

(Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel, the music director, conducts two exercises in orchestral luxury: Stravinsky's ''Chant du Rossignol'' and the second of Ravel's ''Daphnis et Chloé'' Suites. He also leads the admirable Anne-Sophie Mutter in Berg's Violin Concerto. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $33 to $99. (Holland) GIL SHAHAM AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) This omnipresent and very talented violinist joins eight colleagues, including the mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung, in a not-your-everyday Brahms program: the Horn Trio, two songs with viola and piano, and the Clarinet Quintet. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out.

The program includes the Violin Concertos Nos. 2 and 4 (K. 211 and 218), with Mr. Vengerov's own cadenzas, and the Sinfonia Concertante in E flat (K. 364), with the violist Lawrence Power -- repertory this group recently recorded for a new disc on EMI.

Núñez, the music director of this chorus, has long believed that at an early age, musicians should develop, and benefit from, associations with established composers. The group's ''Transient Glory'' program offers premieres of works written for the young choristers by Ned Rorem, Bruce Adolphe, Michael Gordon, Meredith Monk and Tarik O'Regan. At 7:30 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, ypc.org; $25; $10 for parents and students. (Tommasini) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AILEY II (Tonight through Sunday) Alvin Ailey created a second, or junior, company in 1974, almost casually, as a way of working on new choreography. Ailey II is now a world-class troupe, filled with dancers who are not only good but also capable of performing with a youthful hunger, as well as with a reverence for dance that is a part of the mission of the company director, Sylvia Waters, whom Ailey himself chose to direct that first group. Now Ailey II is coming home, performing in the black-box theater that is part of the Ailey headquarters: newer, grander and more gleaming than Ailey ever envisioned. The repertory will include new dances by Abdel Salaam, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Jessica Lang, along with Ailey's ''Streams'' and a chunk of Ailey highlights. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, alvinailey.org; $40; $10 student rush tickets available. (Jennifer Dunning) BEST OF THE BOROUGHS: NIA LOVE/BLACKSMITH'S DAUGHTER DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Love represents dance in this festival, and if past programs are any guide, she will do that with a maximum of heat and wit. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) JANE COMFORT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Comfort can be depended on for thought-provoking dance and theater pieces, often explorations of politics and sexuality. At 8:30, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21. (Dunning) CONFIGURATION DANCE (Tuesday) From Cape Cod and unaccountably headed south, this company will perform dances by Michael Shannon, Sasha Janes, Yuri Zhukov and Harrison McEldowney, the resident choreographer of the company, which is directed by Joseph Cipolla, formerly of the Birmingham Royal Ballet in England.

(Dunning) * EIFMAN BALLET OF ST. PETERSBURG (Tonight through Thursday) There is no one in world dance quite like Boris Eifman, for better or for worse. Whatever else he is, Mr. Eifman is a theatrical genius whose ballets are almost always flamboyant fun. This week the company will perform his new ''Seagull,'' after the Chekhov play, through Sunday, followed by ''Russian Hamlet'' on Wednesday and Thursday. (Through April 29.) Tonight and Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $100. (Dunning) GENDER BENDER: MONICA BILL BARNES AND NICHOLASLEICHTERDANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Barnes's modern-dance choreography is known for its theatricality and knowing humor. And Mr. Leichter explores race and sex with provocative pairings of dancers in work that draws from traditional and street-dance styles. At 8:30, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $17 to $25. (Dunning) KENNEDY DANCERS (Thursday) Based in Jersey City, this modern-dance troupe will celebrate its 30th anniversary with a program of dances by the company director, Diane Dragone, with one work by a different guest group each night. Donna Scro Gentile's Freespace Dance will perform at the opening. (Through April 28.) At 7:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (201) 659-2190; $20; $18 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Peter Kyle Dance (Tonight through Sunday night) Peter Kyle was a longtime dancer with Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, and he now makes intelligent, humorous work that seems to be frequently inspired by literature. This program of new pieces features ''Nearer'' and ''Fallow Bogs,'' both with live music; and ''On the Divide,'' inspired by Willa Cather's ''O Pioneers.'' At 8, Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas) * LAR LUBOVITCH DANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Known for the rich flow of his modern-dance choreography, Mr. Lubovitch and his eloquent dancers will present two programs, which include ''Little Rhapsodies,'' with Rasta Thomas, a guest dancer, and Pedja Muzijevic, who will play the piece's Schumann piano score, as well as the music for ''Dvorak Serenade in E.'' Tonight's gala program also includes ''Recordare,'' performed by the Limón Dance Company At 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, www.skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $250, $500 and $1,000 tonight; $45 tomorrow. (Dunning) BARBARA MAHLER (Tonight through Sunday) ''There's No Place Like Home''' features choreography distinguished by tight focus and strong physicality. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jack Anderson) LA MAMA MOVES! (Thursday) More than 50 companies and soloists, chosen by Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo, will perform in this celebration of downtown dance, in programs that will spill out throughout the nooks and crannies of the funky La MaMa complex. The festival opens with ''New Virtuosity,'' a program that includes dances by Robert Battle, Patrick Corbin, Tynek Dusan, Sunhwa Chung and Nick Seligson-Ross. At 7:30 p.m., La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) GLORIA MCLEAN (Sunday) Ms. McLean, a leading dancer with Erick Hawkins, will present ''Fossil Garden,'' a piece that unfolds amid a sculpture installation by Ken Hiratsuka. The program, which includes a video and sound installation by Jack Waters and Peter Cramer, takes place in Mr. Hiratsuka's basement studio. At 5 p.m., 516 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 529-5660; donation suggested. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tuesday through Thursday) The company opens its two-month spring season with the first of six performances that will pay tribute to the centenary of Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of City Ballet with George Balanchine, and the founder and longtime director of the School of American Ballet. Eight of the 10 tribute ballets, all choreographed by Balanchine, will be presented in three programs this week, including ''The Four Temperaments,'' ''Pavane,'' ''Agon,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Duo Concertant,'' ''Square Dance'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements.'' Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570; (800) 580-8730, nycballet.com; $15 to $95. (Dunning) * Stephen Petronio Company (Tuesday through Thursday) Stephen Petronio has a reputation for making provocative, sexually charged dances, but his work can often be as much about identity as about sexuality. A new solo, ''For Today I Am a Boy,'' is set to the music of the avant-garde British singer Antony, and seems set to explore such issues. Also on the program are another new piece, ''Without You II''; a revival of Mr. Petronio's 1997 ''ReBourne''; ''The Ship Song,'' (part of a work made in 2003 for the Sydney Dance company); and last year's enjoyable ''Bud Suite.'' Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40; $30 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) PMT SHOWCASE (Tomorrow and Sunday) The program will feature dance by David Kieffer, Kai Kleinbard, Yesid Lopez, Ami Mattison, Brenda Neville and Pavan Thimmaiah, the hip-hopster who produced the showcase. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Martin Luther King Jr. High School, 122 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-5694; $16; $10 for students. (Dunning) QUEENS THEATER ASIAN CULTURAL FESTIVAL: KUN-YANG LIN/DANCERS (Tonight) Mr. Lin is one of many Asian crossover choreographers, but his distinctive blend of traditional and Western dance has the dark, bold force of a woodcut print. At 8, Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $28; $26 for 65+; $20 for students. (Dunning) WORKS AND PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM: 'SLOW DANCING' (Sunday and Monday) Subtitled ''Motion Portraits of Dancers,'' this program of larger-than-life, slow-motion video portraits by David Michalek will focus on dancers including Desmond Richardson, Wendy Whelan and Herman Cornejo, with a panel discussion including Mr. Michalek and Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand's weaknesses -- repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists -- it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. And it covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) The Jewish Museum: Dateline: Israel: 'New Photography and Video Art,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the Metropolitan Museum of Art : 'Journeys: Mapping the Earth and Mind in Chinese Art,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the met: 'Venice and the Islamic World, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) Museum of Contemporary American Diasporan Arts: 'Postmillennial Black Madonna,' through May 13. This group show of young artists takes various approaches to the female figure as myth and symbol in contemporary African-American cultures. 80 Hanson Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492. A complementary show is at the Skylight Gallery of the Restoration Plaza, 1368 Fulton Street, third floor, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 636-6976, through May 5, mocada.org or postbme.com. (Cotter) * Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org (Roberta Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Bridget Goodbody) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * Nancy Brooks Brody Some of the abstract ''paintings'' in this beautiful, reticent solo show have been stitched with cotton thread onto paper, creating patterns of linear ridges. Others are made from painstakingly detailed pencil patterns on plaster. The effect is like having Agnes Martin's bars and bands transmitted as sound waves, a soft, vibrant humming. Ms. Brody's sculptures of stacked bars of bath soap, used but not used up, are right in the poetic picture. Virgil de Voldère Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Room 416, (212) 343-9694, virgilgallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter) * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com, through May 5. (Smith) * JONATHAN MONK: 'SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT' As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and René Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and ''The Cheat,'' in which ''this'' and ''that'' consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com, through May 5.(Smith) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, ubs.com, through April 27. (Glueck) Last Chance * Chelsea Art Museum: 'DANGEROUS BEAUTY' A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society's ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show -- often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media -- feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org., closes tomorrow. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOAN JONAS An extraordinary double show from a performance-installation-video artist who emerged in the late 1960s and has only gotten better. The centerpiece is a walk-in-collage of sculpture, props and video projections derived from a new performance work, ''The Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things,'' accompanied by a film of the performance. Based on a memoir by the art historian Aby Warburg, and accompanied by music composed and played by the jazz pianist Jason Moran, it combines a Fluxus playfulness with task-oriented gestures of early '70s dance to achieve a mysterious visual poetry reminiscent of Joseph Cornell, decanted. Yvon Lambert New York, 550 West 21st Street and 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com; closes on Thursday. (Smith) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975 Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * 'PAINTINGS, FLAGS & IRON: HAITIAN ART FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS' This splendid exhibition offers total immersion in the originality and continued vitality of Haiti's self-taught artists. Works by well-known painters like Hector Hyppolite, Toussaint Auguste and Rigaud Benoit range across religion, history and everyday themes. They include still lifes, landscapes and Pierre Joseph Valcin's enthralling rendering of a maternity ward. The forged and welded sculptures of Georges Liautaud and Gabriel Bien-Aimé are on a par with Bill Traylor's antic silhouette drawings. And there are no words for the extravagantly sequined and beaded flags depicting Voodoo spirits and saints, except fabulous. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",4fd27b8e8eb7c8105d840cef,15452

'MEMORY' Previews start tomorrow. Opens on Thursday. Part of the increasingly essential Brits Off Broadway festival, a new play by Jonathan Lichtenstein (''The Pull of Negative Gravity''), about the way people choose to remember events, reveals how the Holocaust still haunts the present. Terry Hands directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. '110 IN THE SHADE' In previews; opens on Wednesday. Audra McDonald stars in the Roundabout's revival of the musical version of N. Richard Nash's ''Rainmaker.'' Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.

The Joe's Pub veteran and pop singer Stew tries his hand at musical theater, with a rock-theme score and a story about the journey of a black bohemian (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 'RADIO GOLF' In previews; opens on Tuesday. The last play in August Wilson's cycle is set in 1997 and centers on the vital question of what will be done with the fabled Aunt Esther's house. Tonya Pinkins (''Caroline, or Change'') stars (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this rollicking melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together right now. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES OF COMEDY' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302. (Wilborn Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE ACCOMPLICES' Bernard Weinraub, a former reporter for The New York Times, has chosen a worthy subject for his first play: In 1940, the young Zionist Peter Bergson was determined to persuade the United States government to open its arms to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Unfortunately, this production takes a hagiographic approach to its protagonist, emphasizing his heroism at the expense of more complex characterization. (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (David Ng) 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES' The trick to refashioning beloved children's books for the stage is to keep both the spirit and the story largely intact. In this, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford -- a musical-theater partnership of five decades' standing, who have moved from their hit ''I'm Getting My Act Together'' to the American Girl demographic -- have largely succeeded. This breezy, upbeat musical avoids slickness and gets the job done, and is nicely cast into the bargain (1:30). The Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Anne Midgette) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'JANE EYRE' Staged as a psychological drama, this new version of an oft-adapted classic is a shadowy, fluid, engaging production (2:45). Baruch Performing Arts Center's Nagelberg Theater, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE VIEW FROM K STREET STEAK' An attempt at political satire that misses with just about every shot, this play ends up being simply confusing and boring, neither funny nor timely (1:50). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DIGGERS' (R, 90 minutes) This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, about clam diggers on the south shore of Long Island has the brave, mournful tone of a Springsteen song (''My Hometown,'' say) set in Billy Joel territory. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Manohla Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) 'KICKIN' IT OLD SKOOL' (PG-13, 107 minutes) Jamie Kennedy tries to lead a break-dancing revival, playing a man who was left in a coma by a break-dancing accident in 1986 and has only just now come out of it. Funny early, but grows less so, and the dancing sequences aren't as exciting as they ought to be. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'SING NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE' (No rating, 94 minutes) A would-be ''Big Chill'' for 30-somethings, ''Sing Now'' concerns the 15-year reunion of a college a cappella group for a classmate's wedding in the Hamptons, and its attendant midlife crises. But the ensemble cast is too unwieldy, and interesting characters are given short shrift. Only Molly Shannon, in a selfless, robust performance, registers amid the suds. (Andy Webster) 'SNOW CAKE' (No rating, 112 minutes) Sigourney Weaver peels off layers of urbane sophistication to play a high-functioning autistic woman living in a rural Ontario town who intersects with an embittered Briton (Alan Rickman). Their technically accomplished performances partly camouflage the suds. (Holden) 'SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT' (No rating, 64 minutes) Betsy Blankenbaker's plodding but heartfelt documentary celebrates the career of Indiana's Crispus Attucks Tigers, who, in 1955, became the first all-black high school basketball team to win a state championship. Interspersing grainy game film and interviews with original team members, like the N.B.A. legend Oscar Robertson and the former Harlem Globetrotter Hallie Bryant, the movie pays tribute to a time when basketball scholarships and N.B.A. opportunities were unknown. Back then, a player's only opportunity was to make history. (Catsoulis) * 'SYNDROMES AND A CENTURY' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Thai) Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a Thai director who has become a star of the international festival circuit, makes films that are difficult, abstract and mysterious in the best art-cinema tradition, but at the same time characterized by unusual warmth and generosity of spirit. ''Syndromes,'' suggested by the lives of the filmmaker's parents and the music of Mozart, is a two-part invention on the themes of chance and longing, shot with an intoxicating mix of suavity and sensuality. (Scott) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This Bollywood movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame'' meets ''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals AN EVENING WITH ANDREAS HYKADE AND MARIUSZ WILCZYNSKI (Monday) This evening includes works by two leading contemporary animators, Andreas Hykade from Germany and Mariusz Wilczynski from Poland. ''The Runt,'' the concluding episode of Mr. Hykade's trilogy of ''country films,'' will have its United States premiere; Mr. Wilczynski's latest work, ''Kizi Mizi'' -- which the director describes as ''a tough love story between a cat and a mouse'' -- will have its world premiere. Both animators will be on hand to discuss the works. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) RADICAL SCAVENGER: THE FILMS OF EMILE DE ANTONIO (Today through Thursday) The director Emile de Antonio reinvented the art of the collage film in the documentaries he made from 1963 to 1989, the year of his death. He raided network news footage and archival sources to select sounds and images that he would then recombine into radical political statements. This series at the Anthology Film Archives begins tonight with a new print of Mr. de Antonio's most celebrated and influential film, ''In the Year of the Pig'' (1968). A pointed assemblage of television reports about the Vietnam War, both abroad and at home, ''In the Year of the Pig'' was among the most widely seen protest films in the United States. Among the other titles: ''Rush to Judgment'' (1966), di Antonio's critical analysis of the Warren Report (made with the conspiracy theorist Mark Lane); ''America Is Hard to See'' (1970), about the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy; and ''Millhouse: A White Comedy'' (1971), a comic portrait of Richard M. Nixon. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) WILD AT HEART: BARRY GIFFORD (Tuesday) The novelist and screenwriter Barry Gifford will attend a screening of ''Wild at Heart,'' David Lynch's 1990 film adapted from Mr. Gifford's novel about a pair of extremely star-crossed young lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern). This will be the rarely screened European version, which includes, if memory serves, a little extra gore than Americans were allowed to see in the R-rated film released in theaters here. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AIR (Thursday) This French duo, whose every electronic note seems to drip with breathy, limply funky pop nostalgia, plays as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com or highlinefestival.com; $36 and $46. (Ben Sisario) * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) The songs in ''Simply Styne,'' Ms. Akers's beautiful tribute to the composer Jule Styne, have been arranged into a touching, tongue-in-cheek cabaret answer to ''Scenes From a Marriage.'' The pianist Don Rebic is her witty partner in deconstruction. (Through May 12.) At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30. (Stephen Holden) ANTIBALAS (Tomorrow) This Brooklyn collective worships the musky Afro-funk of Fela Kuti, and can produce a credible facsimile of it, thickly textured with reverb-heavy guitars and brawny horns. Its latest, ''Security'' (Anti-), also follows Fela's other big legacy: no-holds-barred denunciations of political oppression and corruption. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE, THE NATIONAL (Monday through Wednesday) Arcade Fire became king of the indie-rock mountain with a lovable, artsy eccentricity and a disarming emotional clarity. Its new album, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), is dark and preoccupied but satisfyingly cathartic. The National, from Brooklyn, plays flawless, wilting ballads threaded with subtly brilliant guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the dry, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger. Monday and Tuesday at 7 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com or highlinefestival.com; sold out. (Sisario) THE BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Web site for this lollapalooza in the Giants Stadium parking lot has a faux radio station, complete with obnoxious promo spots crackling with pyrotechnic sound effects. It's unfortunately appropriate for the Bamboozle, a roll call of more than 100 young hard-rock bands that, once you get past the headliners, sound utterly interchangeable and predictable -- the kind that make you want to change the station. My Chemical Romance and Muse headline tomorrow, and Linkin Park on Sunday. A few highlights are Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Killswitch Engage, Weird Al Yankovic, Captured by Robots, Lordi, Andrew W. K., and Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock (''It Takes Two''). At noon, Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, thebamboozle.com; $35 each day. (Sisario) * BEIRUT, FINAL FANTASY (Sunday through Tuesday) A year ago Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque who records as Beirut, released ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber, sepia-toned marches with touches of Balkan brass. He quickly became a celebrity among music bloggers, which means that by now Beirut has become a kind of blog classic rock. As Final Fantasy, Owen Pallett creates nervous universes in miniature, looping ribbons of violin around his quavering voice. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * BJORK (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's been a long time since Bjork's combination of wailing indie-rock, eroticized electronica and use of random musical props -- Inuit choirs, beatboxers, African kora players -- has been truly avant-garde, or even surprising. But her latest album, ''Volta'' (Elektra), still sounds fresh and energized, with every sound becoming her exotic plaything. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Konono No. 1, a Congolese band whose polyrhythmic bubblings are made with amplified thumb pianos, at the United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171; Tuesday at 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; both sold out. Konono No. 1 also plays tomorrow night at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $23. The doors open at 8, and Magik Markers opens. (Sisario) * BLONDE REDHEAD (Tuesday) Its days of spindly, atonal guitar webs apparently behind it, Blonde Redhead has for the last few years been making lusher, more cottony music, as if finally realizing that its amplifiers have reverb buttons. Its latest, ''23'' (4AD), is a gorgeous trip through clouds of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, recalling those kings of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, My Bloody Valentine. With Fields. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BOWLING FOR SOUP (Wednesday) When the venerable British singer and guitarist Richard Thompson put together his album ''1,000 Years of Popular Music,'' his choices included ''Sumer Is Icumen In,'' Renaissance ballads and Cole Porter's ''Night and Day,'' as well as ''1985,'' a gag catalog of '80s nostalgia by this otherwise undistinguished Texas rock band. (''When did Motley Crue become classic rock?/And when did Ozzy become an actor?'') It's a fun karaoke number, though Mr. Thompson may have been making another point: if you were really going to preserve the most representative songs of our culture, you'd have to include some ''1985s,'' right? At 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) BRIGHTBLACK MORNING LIGHT (Tomorrow and Sunday) Though nominally part of the current psych-folk revival, Brightblack Morning Light has a sound that is harder to place, and therefore more intriguing: an electric hum; warbling keyboards that evoke damp funk; and ecstatic, breathy chants, like the rituals of a secret forest cult. The songs on its most recent album were written, the band has said, while living in tents in Northern California. Also on the bill: Daniel A.I.U. Belteshazzar-Higgs with Chiara Giovando. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $13 in advance; $15 at the door. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies; his Electric Trio has had a Monday-night residency forever. Mr. Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. Also on the bill are Kelly Jones and Phillip La Rue. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. (Sisario) CORNELIUS (Thursday) Keigo Oyamada, a Japanese musician who records as Cornelius (he took his name after Roddy McDowall's character in ''Planet of the Apes''), is a witty if cold conceptualist, toying with minimal electronics and off-kilter rhythms that sound like the stimuli of some psychological lab experiment. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) BEN GIBBARD (Tuesday) The singer of Death Cab for Cutie, the indie-rock giants whose spectrum of mood runs from lovelorn and aloof to wistful and aloof, is on a rare solo tour. With David Bazan and Johnathan Rice. At 7:30 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org or bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS (Tomorrow) As stalwart as you can be in indie rock, Mr. Leo has made a long and admirable career matching the musical fury of Clash-like punk with impassioned, highly personal social commentary. His new album, ''Life Among the Living'' (Touch and Go), is a reminder that he is one of the best and most uncompromising songwriters in the game. With Love of Diagrams. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $19. (Sisario) MAGIC NUMBERS (Wednesday) Perfectly jangly bubblegum harmonies of mid-'60s vintage get a slight melancholy twist with this British foursome, made up of brother-and-sister pairs. With All Smiles. At 7 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) * MARTIRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) This Spanish singer, long a curious mingler of pop, jazz and flamenco, recorded her new album, ''Primavera en Nueva York'' (Calle 54), in New York with a jazz band, its boleros reinterpreted as a languorous, savory jazz suite. She makes her New York debut at Joe's Pub. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario) MOE (Tonight through Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacey interludes or the borderline of funk. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. (Jon Pareles) NEKROMANTIX (Sunday) Is it Halloween already? This Copenhagen trio follows the ''Munsters''-as-punk lead of the Misfits and the Cramps with a full sideshow of warped rockabilly, B movie titles (new album: ''Life Is a Grave & I Dig It!'') and, most important, ghoulish stacked hairdos. With Heart Attacks, Westbound Train and Orange. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $12.50. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung over light strums of guitar and with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called the ''Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks & Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Holden) DULCE PONTES (Thursday) This Portuguese singer's champions (or at least her publicists) call her the successor to the fado queen Amália Rodrigues. Not quite: Ms. Pontes's style has leaned pretty far toward the soapy and homogenized glitz you can hear every year at the Eurovision festival. (Ms. Pontes was a competitor in 1991.) But she has a strong, fleshy alto, and for this Carnegie Hall appearance will sing traditional songs from her lovely new album, ''O Coração Tem Três Portas,'' with a small acoustic ensemble. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo. If you've got as much rhythm in your body and music in your head as Ms. Ross does at 76, who indeed could ask for anything more? At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) * SHIVKUMAR SHARMA AND ZAKIR HUSSAIN (Tomorrow) Shivkumar Sharma plays the santur, India's hammered dulcimer, and has transformed it from an accompanying instrument into a solo instrument that brings shimmering resonances to the classical Indian raga repertory. He will be accompanied by Zakir Hussain on tabla, who can supply subtle propulsion and percussive fireworks over the course of a raga. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536, the-townhall-nyc.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $25 to $45; $15 for students. (Pareles) SIX PARTS SEVEN (Tonight) The Six Parts Seven, from Kent, Ohio, play instrumental rock that unfolds with deliberation and inexorable grace, working through minimalistic guitar-picking patterns and gradual buildups that quickly become mesmerizing. With Trouble Books, Ghosts of Pasha and Yellow Fever. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Pareles) SLOAN (Thursday) Like modern metafictions, Sloan's pop-rock songs twist inward on themselves. With their winsome tunes and neo-Beatles intricacies, Sloan's songs are not just about unrequited yearnings, but also about the process of writing pop songs about unrequited yearnings. They're rarely so clever that their heart doesn't come through. With Small Sins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $20. (Pareles) SUNSET RUBDOWN (Tonight) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Katie Eastburn and Get Him Eat Him. At 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * AMY WINEHOUSE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The British R&B revivalist of the moment, Ms. Winehouse growls defiant epigrams of debauchery (''They tried to make me go to rehab/I said no, no, no'') over tasty arrangements that, were it not for the whiff of hip-hop in the rhythms, could pass for lost 1960s soul tracks. With Patrick Wolf on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. Mr. Wolf also plays on Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. KARRIN ALLYSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Allyson is an effervescent jazz singer whose recent album ''Footprints'' (Concord) convincingly delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese. (Through May 12.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen) SAM BARDFELD'S STUFF SMITH PROJECT (Thursday) Sam Bardfeld, a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé, pays tribute to a swing-era hero of his instrument with help from the pianist Anthony Coleman, the bassist Sean Conly and the guitarist and singer Doug Wamble. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) TIM BERNE'S LITTLE SATAN (Wednesday) The alto saxophonist Tim Berne presents a coy riff on his established skronk-improv trio Big Satan: the drummer Tom Rainey remains, but Kieran Daly on electric mandolin fills in for the guitarist Marc Ducret. At 8 and 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) MICHEL CAMILO (Tuesday through Thursday) A percussive, often cathartic pianist, Mr. Camilo has a new album, ''Spirit of the Moment'' (Telarc), that captures the crisp interplay of his Latin-jazz trio with the bassist Charles Flores and the drummer Dafnis Prieto. (Through May 13.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' which was introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast, notably the captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. Some major changes are coming to the cast, though, for the final performances. The accomplished American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, in his Met debut role, makes a sweet-toned, technically agile and appealing Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is a hardy and clever Figaro. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets available. (Anthony Tommasini) LA GRAN SCENA OPERA COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the tradition of every great diva who just can't say goodbye to the stage, Mme. Vera Galupe- Borszkh is following last year's 20th annual and absolute last farewell with a return engagement, ''Back by Personal Whim (and Popular Demand).'' Mme. Vera, for the two or three opera lovers in New York still unfamiliar with her name, is a creation of the brilliant Ira Siff, who skewers opera and its mores as only one steeped in it can. Madame's recitals are a combination of stand-up comedy and ''Vissi d'arte,'' and have been shown to be suitable even for nonopera fans -- if they can get tickets. At 8, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, granscena.org; $33. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) The Met's new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, is now the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man who has just died. The earthy soprano Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, the impassioned soprano Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica and the stylish baritone Alessandro Corbelli as the shrewd Schicchi are standouts, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe almost steals each show playing three supporting roles. James Levine conducts vibrant and beautifully refined performances. Tonight at 8, Monday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $205 tickets available tonight; $175 for Monday and Thursday. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Tuesday) Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant take on a Puccini fantasy of Far Eastern bloodthirstiness and lust helps wind down the Met's season. Erika Sunnegardh continues in the title role. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 tickets remaining. (Bernard Holland) Classical Music * PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Thursday) During his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall this season, this astounding French pianist has revealed himself to be a fascinating concert programmer and astute music historian. The next-to-last of his Perspectives concerts, called ''Programming Games,'' offers an eclectic evening of 20th-century works for piano and percussion by Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Gyorgy Kurtag, culminating in Bartok's exciting Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. You can be sure that Mr. Aimard will have an intriguing explanation for having included Steve Reich's ''Clapping Music'' in the mix. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Tommasini) AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Composers, especially young ones, have too few chances to hear their new orchestral works performed. Part concert, part service, part competition, this orchestra's annual new-music readings address the gap, selecting nine composers (from 150 submissions this year) to receive feedback from mentor composers and conductors. One of the nine will win a $15,000 prize and an official premiere at an American Composers Orchestra concert; all will hear their music performed by a professional orchestra -- a prize in itself.

(Vivien Schweitzer) MATTHIAS GOERNE AND CHRISTOPH ESCHENBACH (Monday) Call it the Fischer-Dieskau effect: Germany has produced a whole crop of fine baritones, and one of the finest is Matthias Goerne, with a dark, full voice; a slightly distracting penchant for onstage gesticulation; and a constant search for artistic stimulation that will push him to extend his artistic horizons. Christoph Eschenbach, moving off the podium and taking his place as accompanist, joins him for a concert of Schumann (including the Op. 24 ''Liederkreis'') and Brahms (including ''Vier Ernste Gesänge,'' a wrenching set to which Mr. Goerne should do full justice). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Midgette) INTERPRETATIONS (Thursday) To celebrate the composer Chinary Ung's 65th birthday, several ensembles and soloists -- Antares, the Brentano String Quartet, the cellist Maya Beiser, the percussionist Steven Schick and the baritone Thomas Buckner -- are joining forces to play some of his music.

The program also includes Poul Ruders's ''Credo'' and ''Trapeze,'' and Schumann's Symphony No. 2. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98.

At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25; $15 for students, 65+ and artists. (Sulcas) RAGAMALA MUSIC AND DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) From Minneapolis, the company mixes Indian Bharatanatyam dance with contemporary movement, Japanese taiko drums and a capella singing. (Through May 13.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $12.50 to $35. (Dunning) SKOVE WORKS (Thursday) Lily Skove and her modern-dance company will present ''SPLIT,'' a collaboration with the lighting designer T J Hellmuth that plays with hidden and obstructed perspectives in shadowy spaces that might be rooms in a house. And this mustily idiosyncratic performing space would seem the ideal setting. (Through May 12.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) * URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tuesday through Thursday) Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's ''Walking With Pearl: Africa Diaries'' and ''Walking With Pearl: Southern Diaries,'' works based on the travel diaries of the modern-dance pioneer Pear Primus, are the linchpins of the two programs at the Joyce offered by this dynamic company. There are other draws, however: a new work by Camille A. Brown, one of the most promising young choreographers around, and a restaging of Blondell Cummings's ''Chicken Soup.'' (Through May 13.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. (Sulcas) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through May 13. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GREY ART GALLERY: 'BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O'DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,' through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE MET: 'VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * NEUE GALERIE: 'VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TARYN SIMON,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown * RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950s & 1960s Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze's alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through May 12. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street * KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn't time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this survey gives a sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'PRIME TIME: MICKALENE THOMAS AND SHINIQUE SMITH' A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com, through May 12. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith) * LILY LUDLOW Best known as a designer for Imitation of Christ and Somnus, Ms. Ludlow offers a handful of draftsmanly paintings for this solo show. Done on faint dark lines on a white ground, each group picture presents nude, semi-classical figures entangled in what appear to be ethereal, sadistic ballets. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Chinatown, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork. com, through May 13. (Cotter) Last Chance DELPHINE COURTILLOT From O. Winston Link to Anna Gaskell and ''The Blair Witch Project,'' there are far too many borrowed bits in these large watercolors based on staged photographs of people in dark, desolate landscapes. But the larger question is why the images wouldn't do just as well in their original photographic form. Tilton Gallery, 8 East 76th Street, (212) 731-2221, jacktiltongallery.com; closes tomorrow.(Smith) * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny, meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN LASKER One of the tortoises of '80s painting, this artist has cultivated his narrow abstract vocabulary without painting himself into a corner, and this latest show is one of his best. The usual asides to the history of abstract painting continue, as does the almost garish postmodern style, but there is more coherence in both single works and the group. Perhaps this is because Mr. Lasker's hand and brush have always stayed in the picture, subverting yet partaking of traditional touch and surface. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7737; closes tomorrow. (Smith) ORLY GENGER: MASSSPEAK More than three tons of nylon climbing rope knotted into mats and arranged in mounds that sometimes touch the ceiling add to the tradition of filling gallery space with unusual quantities of just one thing for an effect that is at once dour and hilarious, like a playground designed by a Welsh miner. Larissa Goldston, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7887, larissagoldston.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN MONK: 'SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT' As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and René Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and ''The Cheat,'' in which ''this'' and ''that'' consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith * MAY STEVENS: 'ASHES ROCK SNOW WATER' The outstanding piece in this beautiful show of recent work is a mural-size painting of eddying water, the surface flecked with glinting bits of mica and amber, as if spirits were moving beneath the turbulence. Mary Ryan Gallery, 527 West 56th Street, (212) 397-0669; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * TEMPORARY SERVICES: 'GROUP WORK' Temporary Services, an inventive Chicago-based artists' collective, was given the run of Printed Matter's archives and came up with a fascinating selection of collectively published materials covering several decades. In addition, the group has installed a photographic installation that touches on the many things that ''group'' may mean, from Apostles, to Immigrants, to Upper Class. Printed Matter Inc., 195 10th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 925-0325; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON' This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",4fd276018eb7c8105d835af1,15146

New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. 'IN THE HEIGHTS' In previews; opens on Feb. 8.

Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GET YOUR WAR ON' Based on the absurdist comic strip of David Rees, this sardonic history lesson of the past six years will delight Bush-haters (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'RIDDLELIKELOVE (WITH A SIDE OF KETCHUP)' This one-woman show, in which Julie Fitzpatrick tells of her friendship with a deaf woman, is cloying and thin, but the sign-language interpretation provided at each performance gives it an interesting extra dimension, helping to bring the subject to life (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Ginia Bellafante) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'THE VIETNAMIZATION OF NEW JERSEY (AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY)' A revival of Christopher Durang's satire of war, family life and Bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the Yale Repertory Theater, swishes along at the speed of a Nascar race. Blanche Baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the Eisenhower era. the Beckett Theater, on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'FLUKE' A meditative collage of enigmatic riffs on ''Moby-Dick'' presented by the rambunctious experimental company Radiohole (1:30). Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2251. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.

(Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'PURITY' The provocateur Thomas Bradshaw's horror show confronts black-on-black racism (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday. (Zinoman) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PARTY TIME' This multimedia work by the Talking Band looks great, but it's really just a reworking of the old two-guys-in-a-foxhole plot. Here the foxhole is a tank in a desert war; its two occupants (Will Badgett and Joe Roseto) sing about their lives and fears as they try to find a rendezvous point. It's visceral without being illuminating (1:00). LaMaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE RAPTURE PROJECT' Marionettes of various faiths clash in this confusing modern take on an old brand of Sicilian puppet theater by Great Small Works. A Susan Sontag puppet makes an appearance, as does one that calls to mind a former New York City police commissioner, but more often than not, the musical accompaniment is the liveliest thing about the show (1:30). The Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'YOU BELONG TO ME: DEATH OF NATIONS, PART V' The fifth, choppily considered installment of the writer and director Josh Fox's millennial play cycle examines the final days of three wars. Should we think about war primarily in terms of the havoc it wreaks on love and sex? He seems to think so (3:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Tuesday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'ABDUCTION: THE MEGUMI YOKOTA STORY' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Japanese) This documentary about the titular 13-year-old girl -- who vanished on the way home from school in Niigata, Japan, in 1977, and was revealed as a pawn in a North Korean spy-training program -- succeeds as a true crime story, a thumbnail history of a painful recent chapter of Asian history and as a portrait of lives transformed by trauma. Meandering in places, but compassionate and engrossing throughout. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Dargis) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis) 'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'CODE NAME: THE CLEANER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) Cedric the Entertainer clogs the arteries of what could have been a savvy riff on the ''Bourne'' films with way too much ham, playing a janitor who wakes up with amnesia, a dead man beside him. A missing computer chip fuels the plot, aided by Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan. Though it's all too dumb to amuse grownups, it's harmless fun for tweener types. (Genzlinger) 'COMEDY OF POWER' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) Isabelle Huppert is brisk and fierce as a French investigative judge going after corrupt fat cats. The director, Claude Chabrol, is more interested in the forms of ruling-class behavior than in the details of high-level criminality, but his detached, complacent style makes for an interesting contrast with Ms. Huppert's conviction. (Scott) 'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'FREEDOM WRITERS' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Hilary Swank uses her characteristic neediness to fine effect in a true-to-life story about a teacher making a difference in a Southern California high school. The writer and director Richard LaGravenese provides the smartly laid foundation, but it's the kids who give the film its strong emotional tug. (Dargis) * 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Stephen Holden) 'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis) 'GURU' (No rating, 166 minutes, in Hindi) The Tamil director Mani Ratnam makes the case for India's growing economic clout with this entertaining epic about the rise and rise of Gurukant Desai, a fictitious Mumbai polyester manufacturer. The actress Aishwarya Rai, as Guru's wife, is a welcome presence, but the picture belongs to Abhishek Bachchan, who gives a rich, varied performance in the title role. (Andy Webster) 'HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER' (PG, 87 minutes) Like Dreamworks's ''Shrek'' comedies, ''Happily'' is a grab-bag parody set in a fantasyland derived from bedtime stories and Disney films. The adopted chambermaid Ella (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, drawn like Winona Ryder) and the poor dishwasher Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) battle Ella's wicked stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver). Despite self-aware touches, this is another tired kidsploitation product in which a wasp-waisted ingénue and a shallow beau drive the plot and live happily ever after. (Seitz) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) 'MISS POTTER' (PG, 92 minutes) In ''Miss Potter,'' Renée Zellweger, her face pickled in cheeriness, is Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin and Mrs. Tittlemouse, among other beloved characters in children's literature. As portrayed by Ms. Zellweger, Potter is almost as chipper as Julie Andrews's Mary Poppins, a proto-feminist, proto-environmentalist and perfect lady to boot. There was plenty of drama in Potter's life, but the movie turns major conflicts and losses into minor setbacks in a charmed, entirely virtuous life. The movie is far too nice for its own good. (Holden) 'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) In this chaotic, overstuffed family comedy, Ben Stiller is a night watchman at the American Museum of Natural History, where the exhibits come to life at night and attack him and one another. This computerized spectacle spares no expense, but the storytelling is weak, and the hit-or-miss jokes miss more than hit. (Holden) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. DJ (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) 'WE ARE MARSHALL' (PG, 128 minutes) This fact-based story of a West Virginia college town recovering from the death of its entire football team in a 1970 plane crash is a stiff, manipulative dud that gets wrong everything ''Friday Night Lights'' got right. Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the college's goofy new coach, who whips the replacement team into decent shape. (Holden) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN REMEMBERED (Tonight through Tuesday) A tribute to the late American filmmaker winds up with several seldom seen Altman films: ''Three Women,'' ''Buffalo Bill and the Indians,'' ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ''Tanner '88,'' ''Health,'' ''A Wedding,'' ''Secret Honor'' and ''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean.''

(Dave Kehr) CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) A series of significant documentaries chosen and introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues this weekend. Matt Zoller Seitz, who contributes to The New York Times and publishes The House Next Door Web site, is joined by the director Albert Maysles tomorrow for a screening of Mr. Maysles's 1968 cinéma-verité study ''Salesman,'' and Stuart Klawans of The Nation on Sunday presents Nora Jacobson's hard look at real estate development in Hoboken, N.J., ''Delivered Vacant.''

This week's offerings include Li Yu's Chinese film ''Dam Street,'' about the friendship between a washed-up opera singer and a 10-year-old child, which concludes an extended run, with screenings tonight through Monday. On Thursday there's the Kurdistan-French co-production ''Kilometre Zero,'' a story of the ethnic conflict between Kurds and Iraqis set during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, written and directed by Hiner Saleem. (Through Jan. 28.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) KEN AND AZAZEL JACOBS (Tonight through Tuesday) Anthology Film Archives is holding the premiere engagements of two new films from the avant-garde eminence Ken Jacobs (whose epic exercise in associative editing, ''Star Spangled to Death,'' has recently been released on DVD) and Azazel Jacobs, a son of Mr. Jacobs who is following in his father's footsteps. ''The Goodtimeskid,'' is by the younger Mr. Jacobs and is a 77-minute color feature that follows two men with the same name and a woman involved with them both over the course of 24 hours in Los Angeles. ''Two Wrenching Departures,'' by the senior Mr. Jacobs, is a black-and-white video piece. First produced as a live performance, it is about two of Mr. Jacobs's friends, the underground filmmakers Jack Smith (''Flaming Creatures'') and Bob Fleischner (''Banners''), who died within a week of each other in October 1989.

(Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * 'THE AMERICAN BEAUTY PROJECT' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Grateful Dead had its origins in the folk revival, but it took a while for the band to find the right balance between long-form psychedelic jams and small-scale, acoustic country-folk. A diverse group of musicians gathers this weekend to pay tribute to the Dead's two eureka albums from 1970. Performing songs from ''Workingman's Dead'' tomorrow are the Klezmatics, Ollabelle, the Holmes Brothers, Jim Lauderdale, Larry Campbell and Tim O'Reagan of the Jayhawks. Playing from ''American Beauty'' on Sunday are Mark Eitzel, Jay Farrar, Espers, Toshi Reagon, Jorma Kaukonen, Dar Williams, Mr. Lauderdale, Ollabelle and Mr. Campbell.

(Ben Sisario) ARAMIRÈ (Tonight) This folk ensemble from the Salento region of Italy is dedicated to one of the lesser-known traditions of the country, the Greek-influenced music of the southeast of Italy's ''heel.'' With strings, accordion, flute and lots of tambourine, it pays particular attention to the pizzica, a galloping six-beat dance related to the tarantella and long used as a faith-healing cure for spider bites. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) * CAMERA OBSCURA (Wednesday) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the expressively plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960s folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With the Essex Green. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15.50 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) * KRISTIN CHENOWETH (Tonight) This Tony Award-winning treasure plays the Metropolitan Opera House; she's only the third musical-theater person the Met has ever presented in a solo gig. Appearing with a 12-piece orchestra and dancers, she is to add some opera arias to her usual repertory. At 8, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $50 to $200. (Sisario) CLIPSE (Wednesday) Comeback stories are rare and sweet in rap. In 2002 this Virginia duo rose all the way to No. 4 with sly rhymes about the criminal life and brutally minimal rhythm tracks by the Neptunes. Since then the Clipse struggled in music-industry purgatory but triumphed with ''Hell Hath No Fury'' (Re-Up Gang/Jive), another cold, lean and virtuosic exercise that was one of the best hip-hop albums of 2006. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) COLD WAR KIDS (Wednesday) The craggy guitars, verge-of-a-breakdown vocals and elliptical songwriting of this band from Austin, Tex., put it at the top of the music-blogger food chain last year. Now comes the hard part: maintaining popularity as the Internet eye roves again. This month the band is bouncing back and forth between New York and Los Angeles each week in a ''bicoastal residency.'' With Illinois and the Virgins. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) MARK EITZEL (Tonight) Depression is Mr. Eitzel's element; as leader of the American Music Club and through a solo career, he has anatomized melancholy down to the molecular level. In a weary voice, with tunes that blur folk songs and torch songs in a smoky haze, he looks at estrangement and betrayal, loneliness and separation, and bad luck. At 8, Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $12. (Jon Pareles) DIAMANDA GALÁS (Sunday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Galás needs only her voice to terrify and seduce. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario) * GLOBALFEST (Sunday) A one-night crash course in some of the best of what is called world music only because there is no other name for it, Globalfest, now in its fourth year, offers a dozen performers from around the planet. Among them, performing on three stages, are the suave Brazilian songwriter Lenine; Dengue Fever, a band from Los Angeles that resurrects the manically eclectic rock of pre-Khmer Rouge Cambodia; Les Primitifs du Futur, a French retro jazz-blues-Gypsy string band; Sara Tavares, a sensuous Cape Verdean singer; Lila Downs, whose take on Mexican rancheras and cumbias can be raucous or reverent; Le Trio Joubran, three oud-playing Palestinian brothers; and Andy Palacio and the Garifuna Collective, from Belize. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com or globalfest-ny.org; $40. (Sisario) GOB IRON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jay Farrar of Son Volt and Anders Parker of Varnaline have built careers on the idea of ragged, rock-tinged roots music: a little less grungy than Neil Young, a bit more plebeian than Bob Dylan. On ''Death Songs for the Living'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), their joint album as Gob Iron, they repaint centuries of American music by the Carter Family, Josh White and Stephen Foster in gray, bleak tones; even Clarence Ashley's sprightly ''Coo-Coo Bird'' gets a despondent rewrite. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; tomorrow at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario) PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer their tribute to Black Sabbath, and if there is any guitar riff especially appropriate for 12-year-olds, it's ''Iron Man.'' At 2:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) HOLMES BROTHERS AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Tuesday) Steeped in blues and gospel, Sherman and Wendell Holmes harmonize and raise the rafters with songs that draw hope from hard times. Their version of gospel is a close neighbor of Southern soul and country. They are joined by Allen Toussaint, the musical statesman from New Orleans, for two sets. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Pareles) JERRY LEE LEWIS (Tonight) People pounded on pianos and hollered about hellfire before Jerry Lee Lewis, but nobody put it together in quite his way, which is the rock 'n' roll way. Now 71, Mr. Lewis recently released his first new album in 11 years, ''Last Man Standing'' (Artist First), which features appearances by the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, all happily overshadowed. With Jack Grace. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $90. (Sisario) LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario) LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight the Broadway soprano Judy Kuhn offers songs by Laura Nyro, who, along with Joni Mitchell, established the model for confessional, force-of-nature women's songwriting. Tomorrow Michael Franks plays his own music, including recent Brazilian-inspired works. At 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario) LUNA LOUNGE (Tonight and tomorrow night) For a decade beginning in 1995, the Luna Lounge was one of the better rock dives on the Lower East Side, and not just for its foosball table; its tiny back room was host to thousands of bands who played free, including some, like Interpol and the Strokes, who went on to bigger things. A year and a half after losing its lease, the club reopens with roomier digs in Brooklyn, and if the bookings are any indication, the indie tradition will continue even if the no-cover policy will not. The Comas, a band from North Carolina with psychedelic leanings, headlines tonight with Falcon, from Brooklyn. Tomorrow features three appropriately little-known New York bands, Orange Park, the Picture and Motel Creeps. At 8, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, lunalounge.com; $10 tonight, $5 tomorrow. (Sisario) HUGH MASEKELA, KLEZMATICS (Sunday) The South African flugelhorn player Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all those styles to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) ERIN McKEOWN (Tuesday and Wednesday) A smiley sprite whose knack for wordplay and light touch on the guitar have sometimes evoked Tin Pan Alley, Ms. McKeown took the plunge in her new album, ''Sing You Sinners'' (Nettwerk), recording 12 nuggets by Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Fats Waller and others (along with one by herself). If her voice is not quite up to the subtleties of wit the songs demand, her joy of discovery is sincere. With Sean Hayes. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) MEXICAN INSTITUTE OF SOUND (Tomorrow) A one-man mash-up of Mexican and Latin American music of the past and perhaps the future, Camilo Lara, from Mexico City, artfully mingles cumbias and cha-chas with dub and slippery electronica. Like Moby, he spins a dream of groovy eternal life through sounds that retain their kitsch and dance potential forever. With the Gritty Midi Gang. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. (Sisario) * MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980s this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. Here the band appears with two worthy descendants: Oneida and Turing Machine, both of Brooklyn. At 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) ANDERS PARKER (Wednesday) Mr. Parker, who led the band Varnaline, immerses his songs in the stoic drama of country and folk music, resulting in a melancholy that is sometimes indistinguishable from cynicism. (''The hours I've wasted here I could have wasted anywhere.'') At 9 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) BOB SEGER AND THE SILVER BULLET BAND (Thursday) In the fall Mr. Seger released ''Face the Promise'' (Capitol), his first new album in a decade. It's O.K., but a better illustration of what remains powerful in Mr. Seger's music was his performance of ''America the Beautiful'' at Game 1 of the last World Series: in a tender, soulful rasp, he evoked rock's gospel roots, and made a simple patriotic ode bring a stadium roaring to its feet. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $79.50. (Sisario) * RICKY SKAGGS WITH BRUCE HORNSBY (Sunday) One of the most virtuosic musicians in bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs sends his fingers flying in a blur over mandolin, guitar and fiddle. He performs with Bruce Hornsby, whose years playing with the Grateful Dead made him a more versatile and playful musician. The two of them have a new album, due in March, that looks particularly versatile and playful: they do a version of Rick James's ''Super Freak.'' Sunday's concert also features opening sets by Shawn Colvin and Paul Thorn. At 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $55 in advance, $60 at the door. (Sisario) SUBDUDES (Tomorrow) The Subdudes, from New Orleans, make cozy, mostly unplugged roots-rock: straightforward sentiments in tunes that mix a little country, a little blues, a little soul, a little zydeco and a little swing. The group's original lineup disbanded in 1996, but three founding members have revived the band and since 2004 released two new albums. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles) ZS (Sunday and Monday) The Zs, one of the most active avant-rock groups in New York, plays kinetic pieces that sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone. On Monday it plays with Dave Longstreth, whose band Dirty Projectors constructs elaborate ''glitch operas'' with precise harmonies and stark pluckings of guitar and strings, all arranged slightly out of whack. Sunday at 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. Monday at 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover.

AMPERSAND/KNEEBODY (Tuesday) The guitarist Tim Ziesmer features his own rock-influenced compositions in Ampersand, with Chris Speed on tenor saxophone, Dave Ambrosio on bass and Ted Poor on drums.

(Nate Chinen) * THE BAD PLUS (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King constitute the Bad Plus, a delivery system for smartly sweeping original songs as well as wryly affectionate renditions of pop tunes. They caused a stir among jazz purists when they first headlined at the Village Vanguard a few years ago; by now the engagement has become a happy ritual, and the band has nothing to prove but its own continuing vitality. (Through Jan. 28.) At 9 and 11 p.m. (with a 12:30 set on Jan. 27), Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) * DON BYRON (Monday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than the clarinetist Don Byron, who will match wits with two very different pianists: Ursula Oppens, a classical interpreter known for the range of her interests, and Kenny Barron, an improviser with a soulfully sophisticated style. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 in advance, $30 on Monday.

(Chinen) MALAMUTE (Tuesday) Though named after a breed of Arctic sled dog, this collective promises something other than steady propulsion; with Jim Black on drums, Kieran Daly on electric mandolin and Nate Wooley on trumpet, it's likely to tumble ahead in fits and starts. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8.

(Chinen) MATTHEW SHIPP (Tomorrow) Mr. Shipp's pianism is often prickly but rarely off-putting, because even his free improvisations tend to follow a faintly linear path. He performs solo here, as on a thoughtful recent album called ''One'' (Thirsty Ear).

(Chinen) JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Ulmer's singing and guitar playing describe an oddly hypnotic combination of influences: Ornette Coleman's polytonality crossed with the psychedelic swagger of Jimi Hendrix.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'ACIS AND GALATEA' (Tuesday) Staged opera or home entertainment? Handel's early pastoral opera has been the subject of debate since it was written. Probably first performed for a private group at a country estate, it was later revived as a staged opera by another manager eager to capitalize on Handel's Italian-opera success -- in competition with Handel's own opera company. Now, New York, having experienced the work on an operatic scale in City Opera's 2001 production, can sample it in a more intimate form: presented by the five-member Aulos Ensemble (acclaimed early-music specialists) and four vocal soloists at the Met -- not the opera, but the museum. At 6:30 p.m., Medieval Sculpture Hall, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Anne Midgette) 'LA BOHÈME' (Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Bohème'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its first airing of the new year, and the Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs returns to sing Mimì, the role with which she made her house debut in 1996. Her Rodolfo is the excellent tenor Marcello Giordani; they both have the vocal and dramatic chops to make an impact in Zeffirelli's massive sets. Ainhoa Arteta is Musetta, Dwayne Croft is Marcello, and Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 tickets remaining. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Monday and Thursday) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread interest among the general public in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving, ponderous and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Plácido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. There are two more performances. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'MOSTLY OPERETTA' (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) The Austrian Cultural Forum's innovative festival, which pairs 20th-century operetta in intimate recitals with contemporary visuals in an effort to move the genre into the 21st century, winds up this week with three programs by Viennese singers who specialize in operetta: two programs that pay homage to some composers forced to emigrate by the Nazis, and a selection of Kurt Weill's songs arranged into what the forum's director calls ''a kind of 'Winterreise.' '' At 7 p.m, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required. (Midgette) * 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Thursday) Mention Rossini and most people come up with ''The Barber of Seville,'' but this work -- in which the composer honed the comic gift that came to the fore in ''Barber'' and other ''opere buffe'' -- hasn't been staged in New York since 1933. The Gotham Chamber Opera has set itself apart among the city's small opera companies with quality performances of less-known operas (with good singers), conducted by the company's founder, Neal Goren: it is opening this frothy piece of fun with a gala performance on Thursday. (The run continues, at normal ticket prices, next week.) At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org; $300. (Midgette) 'THE TENDER LAND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In 1976, when the enterprising Bronx Opera Company first presented Copland's ''Tender Land,'' the composer participated in rehearsals and attended productions. For its current production, the company is using the effective chamber version of the orchestral score arranged by Murry Sidlin. Royston Coppenger is the director, and Michael Spierman conducts. At 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833, bronxopera.org; $20 to $35. (Tommasini) * 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tuesday) The admirable soprano Hei-Kyung Hong gives a beautifully sung and deeply felt portrayal of Violetta in the Met revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production. The other news is the promising performance of an artist who, like Ms. Hong, is also from South Korea: the tenor Wookyung Kim, singing Alfredo in his Met debut season. As a Verdi tenor, Mr. Kim is a little green. But he has an appealing and robust voice, and at his best, sings with ardor and flair. The baritone Charles Taylor, who was ill on opening night, is scheduled to sing Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Tommasini) Classical Music * ALARM WILL SOUND (Tomorrow) This supremely inventive new-music ensemble offers an expansive look at the music of Edgard Varèse in Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series. Among the 10 works on the program are the early ''Grand Sommeil Noir''; ''Ionisation,'' for percussion ensemble; ''Density 21.5,'' for flute; and several orchestral works. The main curiosity, though, is an orchestrated arrangement of the ''Poème Électronique,'' which is normally heard in the electronic tape version that Varèse completed in 1958. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Allan Kozinn) DANIEL BARENBOIM (Tomorrow and Sunday) In a charming and revealing program note (available on carnegiehall.org), Mr. Barenboim writes of having been reared from his earliest years on Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier.'' When he arrived at 12 for his first lesson in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, this formidable teacher opened the score to the Prelude in E minor from Book 1 and told him, ''Play it for me in A minor.'' This weekend Mr. Barenboim, a formidable pianist, will play that prelude (in the original key) in his two-program survey of the complete 48 preludes and fugues from Bach's monumental work. Book 1 tomorrow at 8 p.m., Book 2 on Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Tommasini) KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT (Thursday) This South African fortepianist gave a fine recital at the Miller Theater in November, and returns with another program, as part of the Boston Early Music Festival's series in the Morgan Library & Museum's intimate new hall. His program includes Mozart's Sonata in F (K. 494) and Variations on ''Unser dummer Pöbel meint'' (K. 455); Benda's Sonata in A minor; and Haydn's Variations in F minor. At 7:30 p.m. (preconcert lecture at 7), Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Kozinn) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) Music for four-hand piano used to be a staple of the repertory, particularly in the days before recordings, when the way most people enjoyed music was to play it themselves. In this program seven pianists (including Charles Wadsworth, a past director of the society, and Wu Han, a current co-director, as well as Gilbert Kalish and Anne-Marie McDermott) take on works for four hands by Mozart, Mendelssohn, Fauré, Stravinsky and Lutoslawski (whose Variations on a Theme of Paganini is the only one to employ two separate pianos). Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Midgette) * 'DECASIA' (Thursday) The composer Michael Gordon and the filmmaker Bill Morrison have collaborated on this enveloping multimedia work. Mr. Morrison's contribution is a fast-cut montage of antique films, in which bubbles and other signs of decay create patterns as crucial to the work as the images of cowboys, flappers, factory workers, dancers, parachutists and exotic scenes from the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Gordon's powerful 65-minute score -- played by an orchestra deployed in the balconies -- evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to a barrage of percussion, electric guitars, brass choirs, woodwinds and strings. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25. (Kozinn) * HILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Sunday) In its performance on the Music Before 1800 series, this British vocal ensemble, here in a quartet configuration (David James, Rogers Covey-Crump, Steven Harrold and Gordon Jones), sings the Lassus Requiem, with antiphons and motets by Palestrina interposed between the movements. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $5 off for students and 62+. (Kozinn) KIRILL GERSTEIN (Sunday) The Metropolitan Museum presents the third of four young up-and-coming pianists in its Accolades series. This week the spotlight is on the Russian pianist Kirill Gerstein, who won first prize at the 2001 Arthur Rubinstein Piano Competition and was awarded the 2002 Gilmore Young Artist Award. He will perform Haydn's Sonata in D (Hob. XVI:37), Schumann's whimsical ''Humoresque,'' Ligeti's Études, Busoni's Sonatina No. 6 and an arrangement of the Scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. At 2:30 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $20. (Schweitzer) * MOSCOW SOLOISTS (Thursday) Wu Man, the fleet-fingered and adventurous Chinese pipa player, frequently adds the sound of her exotic instrument to Western ensembles. With the violist Yuri Bashmet and his Moscow Soloists (a group formed in 1992 and made up of young graduates of the Moscow Conservatory), she will perform Tan Dun's Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa (a pipa is a Chinese lute), a work whose premiere she performed in 2001. The program also includes Toru Takemitsu's ''Nostalgia'' and his Three Film Scores for Strings, and Hikaru Hayashi's Concerto for Viola and Strings, ''Elegie.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 and $40. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) Riccardo Muti, the exacting Italian maestro, is in town for two weeks to conduct the Philharmonic. This weekend's program offers the brilliant violinist Vadim Repin in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto and Scriabin's strangely mystical and musically visionary Symphony No. 3, ''Le Divin Poème.'' On Thursday Mr. Muti presents the first of three performances of an all-Italian program, with ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' Respighi's ''Feste Romane'' and a little-known piano concerto from 1885 by Giuseppe Martucci, a work admired by Toscanini, Mahler and, of course, Mr. Muti. Gerhard Oppitz is the soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96. (Tommasini) JORGE FEDERICO OSORIO (Monday) This Mexican pianist has recorded everything from Brahms to Ponce (and, most recently, Mozart violin sonatas with Ani Kavafian) but has only infrequently performed in New York. His solo recital juxtaposes works by two Spanish composers, Soler and Albéniz, with preludes by Debussy, showpieces by Liszt and Beethoven's Sonata No. 30. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $20 to $45. (Midgette) * 'REQUIEM FOR DARFUR' (Monday) The Democracy Council, a human-rights advocacy group, is sponsoring this performance of Verdi's magisterial Requiem by musicians from orchestras including the New York and Berlin Philharmonics and the Met and Philadelphia Orchestras. The event, which benefits Unicef and other charities involved in aid work in Darfur, has Mia Farrow as its host, and features as soloists the soprano Alexandra Deshorties, the mezzo-soprano Sarah Heltzel, the tenor Scott Piper and the bass Morris Robinson; George Mathew conducts. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $27 to $500. (Schweitzer) RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) Even by its own adventurous standards, the Riverside Symphony is offering an offbeat program tomorrow. The most eclectic item is Villa-Lobos's Harmonica Concerto. The harmonica virtuoso Robert Bonfiglio says he has performed the work more than 350 times. I've never heard it. Have you? Here is your chance, on a program that also offers Mozart's ''Haffner'' Symphony and Honegger's Neo-Classical Symphony No. 4 (''Delights of Basel''). George Rothman conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $50. (Tommasini) ABBEY SIMON (Tuesday) The Walter W. Naumburg Foundation is offering a retrospective concert series in which it presents former winners of its competition. Mr. Simon, the pianist, won in 1941, and his recordings of the Romantic repertory have always been highly regarded, with Chopin as a particular favorite. At his ''Naumburg Looks Back'' recital, he plays music of Chopin and Schumann. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) * 'THE SONG CONTINUES' (Tuesday through Thursday) The master classes are going to be a hotter ticket than the recitals at the Marilyn Horne Foundation's annual celebration of the art of song. Leading off at Zankel Hall is the celebrated Barbara Cook; the next night it's the soprano Evelyn Lear; on Thursday it's Ms. Horne herself. The duo recitals by young artists supported by Ms. Horne's foundation, like Joslin Romphf, a soprano, and Lee Poulis, a baritone, on Wednesday; or Hanan Alattar, a soprano, and Timothy Falton, a tenor, on Thursday, have been relegated to the 5:30 time slot at Weill Recital Hall. (The series continues with a gala concert next Friday.) Master classes, Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; recitals, Wednesday and Thursday at 5:30 p.m.; Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 for master classes; $5 for recitals; some events sold out. (Midgette) TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) This string quartet has undergone a few personnel changes in recent years, and in the process its sound and focus have improved considerably. A Beethoven cycle at Lincoln Center two years ago showed it to be in remarkable form. This time Takacs offers Debussy's Quartet and Shostakovich's Quartet No. 11, before returning to Beethoven for the Quartet in A minor (Op. 132). At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn) * TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) This venerable quartet continues its residency at the 92nd Street Y and its commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Schumann's death with a performance of his String Quartet in A minor. The program also includes Schumann's poignant song cycle ''Dichterliebe,'' sung by the fine Canadian lyric baritone Russell Braun, accompanied by the pianist Carolyn Maule. Paul Hecht, an actor, will read poems from Heinrich Heine's ''Lyrisches Intermezzo,'' on which Schumann based these songs. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. RUTH CANSFIELD DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) In its first New York performances, this Canadian company will present three dances by Ruth Cansfield, set to music by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Crumb, that explore characters' hidden stories, movement without artifice and voyages of the soul. At 9, Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (866) 405-5810, ruthcansfield.com; $17; $13.60 for students and 65+.

At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, www.symphonyspace.org; $10. (Dunning) ANDREA DEL CONTE DANZA ESPANA (Thursday) This program of flamenco dance will feature the dancer Marco De Ana and the fusion band Gazpacho Andalú. (Through Jan. 28.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $28; $25 for students and 65+. (Dunning) CHEZ BUSHWICK: 'AMBUSH: A CURE FOR APAP' (Tomorrow) Bless the Bushwickites for this shrug at the phenomenon of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, which brings dance producers to New York City en masse to assess the talent during a hectic few days -- frustrating to some dance artists -- of conferences and performing. Contributors to the Bushwick program are Matthew Barney, Jonah Bokaer, Foofwa d'Imobilité, Sam Kim, Jennifer Lacey, Antonietta Vicario and Jeremy Wade. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Fire Proof, 119 Ingraham Street, Brooklyn, (718) 418-4405, www.bam.org/events; $5. (Dunning) * DIAVOLO (Tomorrow) This Los Angeles-based multimedia company performs ingenious trompe l'oeil spectacles that seamlessly combine dance, gymnastics and cinematic images. Is that a real or a filmed dog racing across the stage? At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, (718) 951-4500, brooklyncenteronline.org; $15 to $25. (Dunning) * JAPANESE CONTEMPORARY DANCE SHOWCASE (Tonight through Sunday) If it's January in New York, it's time for Japanese dance. For this event's 10th anniversary, the Japan Society has relocated to the Joyce. But the eclectic, pop-influenced sampler should be as strange and beguiling as ever. Two programs feature work by Pappa Tarahumara, Kim Itoh & the Glorious Future, Leni-Basso and Noism07. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30; $23 for members. (Claudia La Rocco) * LOWER LIGHTS COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Members of this multimedia group have worked with some pretty impressive people in dance. And how can you go wrong with a company that describes its collaborative process as ignoring one another while allowing for the subtle influence of what is seen out of the corner of the eye? In its new ''CRAM,'' the group will pour dance; a ''live horror film''; sound and noise installations; a ''living sculpture'' using potatoes as percussion; and an orchestra of instruments made from architectural salvage into every cranny of this space. At 8, Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) * SUSAN MARSHALL & COMPANY (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) Ms. Marshall returns with her Bessie Award-winning ''Cloudless,'' a suite of brief distilled dances. (Through Feb. 3.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25. (Dunning) * MONEY MATTERS (Thursday) Sure does, and it matters a lot that Dixon Place raises funds for a much-needed home on Chrystie Street. Performers in this benefit include Souloworks and Gerald Casel and Jessy Smith. At 7:30 p.m., University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736; $10 or more.

And ''Jerome Robbins: An American Icon'' (''2 & 3 Part Inventions,'' ''A Suite of Dances,'' ''In Memory Of '' and ''I'm Old Fashioned'') enters the repertory tomorrow night and is repeated on Sunday and Wednesday.

A collaboration with the visual artist Kenjiro Okazaki and the performance artist Laurie Anderson, ''robots'' will feature what Mr. Okazaki describes as two interactive ''sculptural apparitions.'' The evening also includes performances of Ms. Brown's 1983 ''Set and Reset'' and her 2005 ''how long does the subject linger on the edge of the volume?'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. It covers medical innovation, military hardware, frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This gripping show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org. (Holland Cotter) * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * ROBERT IRWIN: 'WHO'S AFRAID OF RED, YELLOW AND BLUE 3' In the past, Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through Feb. 3. (Cotter) * JAPAN, INC. See this show of work by six painters who are either Japanese or inspired by Japanese culture primarily for Iona Rozeal Brown's dynamic new canvas ''King Kata.'' Through sharpened color and scale and by taking more liberties with her sources, Ms. Brown has markedly increased the visual punch of her characteristic kimono-and-cornrows cross-cultural fusion of cartoons, Japanese woodblock actor prints and gangsta chic. Her contribution underscores the vacuousness of much contemporary realist painting. Kravets Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, through Feb. 17. (Smith) Other Galleries * 'THE CONSTANT POSSIBILITY OF ERASURE,' through Jan. 29. Organized by Donna Harkavy and Gracie Mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. Robert Rauschenberg's 1953 ''Erased De Kooning'' is an important reference point, present through Mike Bidlo's painstaking recreation. Joseph Beuys, Gary Simmons and Christian Xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while Allan Kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. Joanne Stamerra Hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and Jim Dingilian uses smoke. Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Projects, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317. (Cotter) * OLIVER HALSMAN ROSENBERG: 'DADA FOR GRANDMA,' through Jan. 28. Mr. Rosenberg conceived this show of a dozen lovely, small gouache paintings with references to the zodiac, the Kabala and Egyptian and Hindu cosmology as a tribute to his grandmother Yvonne Halsman who died last year. She was the wife of the Dada photographer Phillipe Halsman, and Dada zaniness has its part in the show. The artist has turned the paintings into an ingeniously low-tech ''prayer wheel'' set into motion by the visitor pedaling his grandmother's exercise bicycle. Mr. Rosenberg, a founder of the alternative space Triple Base in San Francisco who is, with Clint Taniguchi, half of the collaborative Crust & Dirt, has other drawings in a box at Triple Candie, worth a look. Little Cakes, 625 East Sixth Street, Apt. 1B, East Village, (646) 342-1056. (Cotter) Last Chance BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. Not surprisingly, her celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. It reduces these often vivid portrayals to the size of their natural, magazine habitat and allows the viewer to skim for the good ones, as if turning pages. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK' If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, sometimes with bits of colored glass scattered over them. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces that he artfully cut, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the city's wired energy and architectural vivacity. The two groups are united for the first time in this show, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * THE MET: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING' If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter) EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MERENGUE: VISUAL RHYTHMS' AND 'THIS SKIN I'M IN: CONTEMPORARY DOMINICAN ART FROM EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO'S PERMANENT COLLECTION,' Although ''Merengue,'' the larger of the two shows at El Museo, is made up almost entirely of paintings, it is about music, namely the national popular music of the Dominican Republic. Most of the 40 or so pictures, dating from the 1930s to the 1990s, document the music being performed or danced to; a few seem to be formal responses to its percussive beat. In a second, smaller show, merengue's vaunted joie de vivre gets some critical prodding from artists of Dominican descent living in New York. El Museo Del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ALTERED, STITCHED AND GATHERED' Art by users might be the subtitle here, given that the show's 26 artists operate in the capacious gap between modernist assemblage and postmodern appropriation. Everything from e-mail messages to Wal-Mart plastic hangers and the movie ''Rambo'' are reused, often to comment on history, consumerism and war. Earlier efforts by Yoko Ono, Ben Vautier and Jaques Villeglé provide background. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org, closes on Tuesday. (Smith) * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD' This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday.

The master parodists return with an excellent title and new jokes at the expense of ''Spring Awakening,'' ''Mary Poppins'' and other shows (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'GONE MISSING' In previews; opens on June 24. The Civilians revive this play with music; based on interviews, it revolves around the theme of loss (1:30).

'ROMEO AND JULIET' In previews; opens on June 24. Oscar Isaac and Lauren Ambrose play the star-crossed lovers in this new Shakespeare in the Park production. Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs. Delacorte Theater in Central Park, midpark at 80th Street, (212) 539-8750. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' (Tony Award, best revival of a musical 2007) Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ESCAPE FROM BELLEVUE' This showcase for the band the Knockout Drops is less a theatrical experience than a slightly uncomfortable hybrid of a stand-up routine and a rock concert. It is also the agreeable if predictable memoir of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his own story -- heavy substance abuse, a couple of trips to Bellevue, a brave new life -- with a knack for anecdote and an ear for dialogue, like a particularly good storyteller at the corner bar. But ultimately, a rock musical, even one as understated as this, rises or falls with its music; fortunately, this band, though a little stolid, is pretty good (1:30). The Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, (212) 307-7171. (Anne Midgette) 'FROM RIVERDALE TO RIVERHEAD' Like a spinoff of the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit ''Bronx Beat,'' three strident, shallow sisters dominate this road play by Anastasia Traina, which repeatedly strikes the notes of a comedy skit but steadily increases the volume to an uncomfortable level of cruelty. Louise (Angelica Torn), her sisters and her luminous and quirky daughter, Rosie (Bess Rous), are driving to visit Louise's son in prison, enduring Louise's loud outbursts of self-pity that escalate into hysteria and abuse. The whole play focuses on these four women in the car, evoking the ''Are we there yet?'' of a family trip until it finally, in every sense, veers off the road (2:00). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500. (Midgette) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' Neil LaBute's latest work, a tale of two badly behaving brothers (played by Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston), is about American adolescence and how it is warped, stolen and willfully extended. Before the double-knotted plot twists take over, it's a cold-eyed, absorbing drama that testifies to its author's very real talents (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL' The Mint Theater Company has unearthed this enthralling Edwardian drama by St. John Hankin about a lazy charmer who returns home to blackmail his wealthy family (2:00). The Mint Theater Company, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Jason Zinoman) * 'THE RULES OF CHARITY' A man with cerebral palsy and the daughter who cares for him are at the center of this scalding play by John Belluso, which hits none of the familiar notes of the works-about-the-disabled genre but many thought-provoking ones. The performances, by the troupe Theater by the Blind, stick with you, along with the unsettling ideas of the play (2:00). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'the house of bernarda alba' A first-rate revival in an adaptation that is somewhat abbreviated but maintains the play's tragic claustrophobia. A fine cast that includes a 12-member chorus that dances the flamenco (1:40). Nagelberg Theater, Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday.

'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CHALK' (PG-13, 105 minutes) This loose-jointed ensemble mockumentary about high school teachers is funny in a squirm-inducing way. (Holden) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) 'HOSTEL: PART II' (R, 94 minutes) A trio of American female students are brutalized and butchered by the rich and twisted in Eli Roth's follow-up to his generally odious ''Hostel.'' Both installments are driven by the same low motivation: to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness. (Laura Kern) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George, Brad and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) * 'PIERREPOINT: THE LAST HANGMAN' (R, 90 minutes) In this meditation on capital punishment and culpability, Timothy Spall, British film's quintessential blundering bloke, sinks his teeth into one of the juiciest roles of his career. His character, Albert Pierrepoint, a once-celebrated English hangman, executed more than 600 people (including 200 Nazi war criminals) from the early 1930s to the mid-1950s. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SURF'S UP' (PG, 90 minutes) Treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet'' comes this ho-hum, computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards. As a young Rockhopper penguin (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) heads for his first professional surfing competition, he learns about love, perseverance and that winning isn't everything. Though infused with a friendly, blue-collar vibe, the movie suggests that a moratorium on penguins might be called for -- despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. (Catsoulis) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) Film Series TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FIFTH MoMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Today through Monday) This richly varied series of films recently restored by the Museum of Modern Art and other members of the International Federation of Film Archives comes to an end this weekend, but there are still some remarkable things to see: The 1942 film ''A Pilot Returns'' (Friday) is one of the propaganda films made for Mussolini's government by Roberto Rossellini, whose politics changed abruptly (''Open City'') at the war's end; August Blom's ''End of the World'' (Saturday) is an apocalyptic thriller made in Denmark in 1916; ''A Man There Was'' (Saturday) is a 1917 feature by Sweden's first major filmmaker, Victor Sjostrom. Sunday brings a double feature of experimental films by Hollis Frampton, ''Zorns Lemma'' and ''Winter Solstice,'' as preserved by MoMA. The festival ends on Monday with Noel Black's cult favorite ''Pretty Poison''; ''Mata Hari,'' a 1931 George Fitzmaurice film featuring Greta Garbo's sexiest pre-code performance; and Otto Preminger's dark and stately 1947 melodrama, ''Daisy Kenyon,'' with Joan Crawford and Henry Fonda. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) THREE BY JAMES BENNING (Today through Thursday) Nothing seems more ordinary than the notion of a landscape photographer, but a landscape filmmaker is something exceptional -- which is just what James Benning is. His work discovers movement and change where others have for so long seen stasis and permanence. The Anthology Film Archives will be screening three of Mr. Benning's recent films in rotation this week, beginning tonight with ''13 Lakes'' and ''Ten Skies'' (both made in 2004), and adding ''One Way Boogie Woogie/27 Years Later,'' a 2005 revisitation of Mr. Benning's celebrated 1977 film ''One Way Boogie Woogie.'' Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LILY ALLEN (Sunday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her wry and snarky best when putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $25. (Ben Sisario) APOSTLE OF HUSTLE, MEMPHIS (Tomorrow and Monday) More evidence that Canada might have more side projects than actual bands: Apostle of Hustle, featuring Andrew Whiteman of Broken Social Scene, plays dreamy washes of guitar over an easygoing rock pulse, recalling the soft points of U2's ''Unforgettable Fire.'' Memphis includes Torquil Campbell of Stars, the superbly urbane indie-cabaret band from Toronto, whose songs are evoked but not equaled by Memphis's delicate melodies and cool dissection of heartbreak. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. Monday at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) * BRAKESBRAKESBRAKES, PELA (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the snarlingly persistent Eamon Hamilton, Brakesbrakesbrakes packs a lifetime of resentment into a taut two-minute power-pop song and turns to wistful country-folk to simmer down. (The band is known simply as Brakes back home in England, but uses the unwieldy triplicate here to distinguish itself from another band named Brakes.) Pela, from Brooklyn, calls its style ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy, Pixiesesque basslines and sharp, sparkling guitars. With Electric Soft Parade. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $14. Tomorrow at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. These two concerts are billed as a full-career Beatles survey: ''From the Cavern to the Rooftop.'' At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the final two performances of ''Celebrating Bobby Short,'' Mr. Feinstein's funny, touching, meticulously researched tribute to this cabaret legend, who died two years ago, his special guests are Barbara Carroll (tonight) and Charles Cochran (tomorrow). This is the jazziest show of Mr. Feinstein's career, and he confidently stands his ground. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at Loews Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Monday) The sunshine of ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), the debut solo album by Mr. Hammond, of the Strokes, shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With the Dead Trees and Medium Cool. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sisario) * YUKA HONDA (Tomorrow) The keyboardist half of the fondly remembered 1990s avant-pop duo Cibo Matto -- who sang kitschy and hilarious confections about the infinite bounty of junk food -- Yuka Honda has kept busy as a solo artist and collaborator. Tomorrow, in a show presented by Tonic, she unveils a new project with Petra Haden, whose own ambitions include an a cappella cover of the Who's album ''The Who Sell Out.'' Also on hand: Sean Lennon, Cyro Baptista and DJ Olive. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org or tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario) LYLE LOVETT, K. D. LANG (Thursday) Lyle Lovett uses the ache in his voice to sound utterly heartfelt even when his songs grow wry and absurd, while his limber band covers the Texas spectrum from swing to honky-tonk to gospel. K. D. Lang's big, sultry voice harks back to a bygone era, when pop and country singers knew how to linger over a song's melody. But in the material she writes and chooses, she has a postmodern self-consciousness, embracing lavish emotions without giving in to them entirely. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $45.50 to $101. (Jon Pareles) MASCOTT (Tuesday) If Aimee Mann had fended off cynicism, she might sound like Kendall Meade, the songwriter and singer of Mascott. Ms. Meade's serenely tuneful songs turn folk-rock into stately pop, wrapping vulnerability and longing in quietly radiant arrangements. With Graham Smith, Ghosts I've Met and Twin Thousands. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Pareles) MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing opens on Tuesday with George Gee's Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra and David Berger's Sultans of Swing recreating ''The Count Meets the Duke,'' the 1961 ''duel'' between Count Basie and Duke Ellington. On Wednesday is Charanga Soleil, which mixes salsa with Congolese guitar rumba and Haitian rara drumming; Thursday is a disco party for Gay Pride Week, with Jai Rodriguez as the host. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Sisario) * MIKA (Tonight) A 23-year-old British singer driven ''identity mad'' by his pop-culture obsessions -- ''I tried to be Grace Kelly/But all her looks were too sad'' -- Mika aims for the glittery pop bombast of Elton John and Queen, and has the gumption to pull it off. With Sara Bareilles. At 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) O'DEATH (Tonight) This raw and ragged New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. Tonight O'Death celebrates the re-release of its album ''Head Home'' (Ernest Jenning). With the Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band and the Super Monster. At 8, Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12. (Sisario) * ONEIDA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Things are best in Oneida songs when the patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's latest album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic blare. Tonight at 8, with Dirty Faces, Brass Castle, Repellent and others, at Trash Bar, 256 Grand Street, at Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn (718) 599-1000, thetrashbar.com; $7. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; free. (Sisario) * PANDA BEAR (Monday) Noah Lennox, better known as Panda Bear, is one of the singers and captains of disorientation in Animal Collective. In that band and on his recent solo album, ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), he sends the sunniest Beach Boys melodies through endless psychedelic transformations, sometimes elegant and sometimes terrifying. With Rusty Santos and Kria Brekken. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MACEO PARKER (Sunday) As the alto saxophonist for James Brown in his prime funk years and later for George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, Mr. Parker has an impeccable pedigree and the skills to match. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Sisario) PEACHES (Wednesday) For Peaches, a former Canadian schoolteacher who became the uninhibited queen of electroclash, sex is everything: liberating force, political stage, social equalizer. Rap-singing over sparse, nervy electronic beats, she is a dance-floor dominatrix who demands pleasure, and demands it her way. (''Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.'') ''Guests'' are promised; expect them to end up entangled with their host in one way or another. At 10 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) MADELEINE PEYROUX, JOSH RITTER (Tomorrow) Like Norah Jones, Ms. Peyroux has become a star by pursuing a gentle and sophisticated, jazz-inflected style -- a jazz-folk halfway point between Billie Holiday and Patsy Cline -- that has no place in the mainstream music business but whose honesty and finesse has struck a chord. Also on the bill is Josh Ritter, a songwriter whose guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $35 to $65. (Sisario) A. R. RAHMAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Rahman became king of the Bollywood soundtrack in the 1990s with a candied, Westernized style that borrows some tricks from Andrew Lloyd Webber. No wonder, then, that Mr. Lloyd Webber looked to him to write the music for ''Bombay Dreams.'' At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $35 to $300. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tonight) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' With Band of Thieves and the New York Howl. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE (Monday) This 1960s protest folker and longtime champion of American Indian rights will surely sing ''Now That the Buffalo's Gone'' and ''Until It's Time for You to Go,'' and maybe even ''Cod'ine,'' which became a garage-rock standard. But fans will wonder -- and maybe cringe at the thought -- that she will also do her best-known number: ''Up Where We Belong,'' the mawkish 1982 smash sung by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, which Ms. Sainte-Marie wrote with Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche, then her husband. With Krystle Warren. At 7:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $30. (Sisario) * TELEVISION, APPLES IN STEREO, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Tomorrow) The jam band of the CBGB era, Television proved that bare art-rock need not have any aesthetic limitations, as Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd's guitars wailed in spiky, sinuous counterpoint, and its songs mushroomed into free-form odysseys of melody and noise. Reunited a couple of times since the early '90s, the band doesn't play often enough, but tomorrow it headlines an afternoon at Central Park SummerStage, with Apples in Stereo, a band from Denver that plays power-pop in bright, primary colors; and Dragons of Zynth, which claims to have an ''auto-physio-psychic'' approach to noisemaking. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Sisario) * RICHARD THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Thursday) From his days as a guitar prodigy in Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson has set his musings on bitterness and romance to subtly virtuosic, Celtic-infused folk-rock. His new album, ''Sweet Warrior'' (Shout! Factory), dips into nuts-and-bolts '50s rock for a series of stark tableaus of a world in conflict, from spiteful exes to a terrified, death-haunted young soldier in Iraq. The vocal quintet Ollabelle worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. At 8, with High Places and Eric Gaffney, at Death By Audio, 49 South Second Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. (Pareles) TRUE COLORS TOUR (Monday) In the best girls'-night-out package tour to come along in years, Cyndi Lauper appears with Debbie Harry, Erasure and a couple of rowdier underground bands: the heavily mascara'd, cabaret-goth Dresden Dolls, and the Gossip, a trio that plays bare but potent blues-punk. Also on the bill: Rosie O'Donnell and Margaret Cho. At 7 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $51 to $205.50. (Sisario) * VOXTROT (Tonight) Like Morrissey or Ray Davies, Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the three-minute rock song -- as well as a fragile voice perfectly comfortable with its limitations -- to focus emotionally compelling character studies. After a steady stream of singles and mini-albums, this Austin, Tex., band finally released its debut LP last month (''Voxtrot,'' on Playlouder/Beggars), a triumph of angst and gush. With Favourite Sons and Au Revoir Simone. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) MARY WILSON (Tuesday through Thursday) A Supreme from its founding in 1959 as the Primettes through all the group's post-Diana Ross incarnations, Mary Wilson comes to Feinstein's at Loews Regency for a two-week cabaret engagement. She's riding a wave of nostalgia in the wake of ''Dreamgirls,'' and her show is to feature standards -- in addition, of course, to Supremes hits. At 8:30 p.m., 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. WESS ANDERSON QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) An alto saxophonist with a tart and bluesy sound, Mr. Anderson enjoys support here from the pianist Aaron Diehl, the bassist Kengo Nakamura and the drummer Jaz Sawyer. (Through June 24.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen) PETER APFELBAUM AND NEW YORK HIEROGLYPHICS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Peter Apfelbaum, a multireedist and pianist, has been celebrating the 30th anniversary of this adventurous African-inspired band, with a roll call that includes Abdoulaye Diabate on vocals and Charles Burnham on violin. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15. (Chinen) RICARDO ARIAS (Tomorrow) Mr. Arias is a Colombian-born improviser whose instrumental arsenal often includes a cluster of balloons. He presents a new commission, ''Trying and Erring,'' for a group that includes the percussionist Sean Meehan and the trumpeter Nate Wooley. At 6 p.m., Bronx River Art Center, 1087 East Tremont Avenue, at West Farms Square, Fordham, (718) 589-5819, bronxriverart.org; $10 suggested donation.

At 8, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) VALENTINA KOZLOVA'S DANCE CONSERVATORY COMPANY (Tonight) This program includes a new piece by Margo Sappington and excerpts from ''The Pharaoh's Daughter'' and ''Raymonda.'' Many of the performers are Ms. Kozlova's students, though the dancers also include Reyneris Reyes of the Boston Ballet. But to watch these young dancers perform is to see solid, inspired training and the handing down of tradition in three dimensions. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30; $20 for 65+ and children under 12.

(Dunning) JODy OBERFELDER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * OUT LIKE THAT! FESTIVAL (Thursday) The festival, which celebrates gay pride in the Bronx, opens with ''She's Got Moves,'' a program of dance by ''fierce, feisty, ferocious'' female choreographers who include Alethea Adsitt, Sharon Estacio and Faye Driscoll.

(Dunning) SENS/NOÉMIE LaFRANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. LaFrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu; free. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M.

David Vaughan will be honored for his critical writing and service as an archivist to the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, with the award presented by Mr. Cunningham. Participants include Martin Duberman, Kirstein's recent biographer, and Robert Gottlieb, the editor and dance writer. Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, dancecritics.org. (Dunning) VISION FESTIVAL XII (Tuesday) The festival, whose goal is to promote collaborations between choreographers, musicians and visual artists, begins on Tuesday with a program featuring work by Marlies Yearby and Cooper-Moore. (Through June 24.) At 9:30 p.m., Angel Orensanz Foundation, 172 Norfolk Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com; $35; $30 in advance. (Dunning) WORKS AND PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM: PILOBOLUS AND INBAL PINTO (Monday) Pilobolus will perform repertory and excerpts from a new piece choreographed collaboratively by Pilobolus and Ms. Pinto, with Avshalom Pollak, who, like Ms. Pinto, is an Israeli choreographer.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from mostly yarn-sewn to the popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman) MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' There are no surprising names in this intriguing show of one or two works by nearly 30 artists from several generations and countries. But the works themselves are often unusual, especially on the early end, as is the richness with which various subjects and techniques ricochet among them. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through June 23. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Art & Language, Stephanie Brooks, Helen Mirra, Ian Wilson In a four-artist show that is, to say the least, spare, the Minimal-Conceptual veterans Art & Language and Ian Wilson join forces with the relative newcomers Stephanie Brooks and Helen Mirra. For the most part, Art & Language sets the terms, first with ''Index 003'' (1973), a kind of teaser about the impossibility of saying nothing, which reads in this context as a defense of the work on view. In addition, everyone else here takes lots of language into their art. Peter Blum Chelsea, 529 West 29th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com, through June 23. (Smith) Kathe Burkhart: 'The Liz Taylor Series: Selections from 1983-2007' The term ''post-feminism'' gains significance when looking at Kathe Burkhart's ''Liz Taylor Series'' paintings. Unlike 1970s feminist artists, Ms. Burkhart doesn't just celebrate famous women; she inhabits one. Ms. Taylor serves as a doppelganger for the artist in paintings that combine movie stills and tabloid images with collaged elements and text. Only a few of the 125 paintings in the series appear here, but they demonstrate how feminism can be retooled for every generation. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com, through June 23. (Schwendener) 'In Defense of Ardor' For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can't irony be ardent? Can't ardor be critically self-aware? Can't passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through June 30. (Holland Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS bilder' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) * 'The Museum of Crime and the Museum of God' Put together by the writer Luc Sante from material from his own collection, this assemblage -- with holy cards and vintage mug shots; protective amulets and 1930s crime novels; photographs of murder scenes and of river baptisms -- is essentially about his life and makes a transfixing show. Apexart, 291 Church Street, between Walker and White Streets, TriBeCa, apexart.org, through June 23. (Cotter) 'The Price of Everything: Perspectives on the Art Market' Marcel Duchamp, who tried to redefine art as an active tool for thinking rather than a passive object of looking, hovers like a damaged angel over this think-piece of a group show organized by the 2006-7 Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The Art Gallery, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, gc.cuny.edu, through June 24. (Cotter) Christian Tomaszewski: 'On Chapels, Caves and Erotic Misery' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) Last Chance * 'Beneath the Underdog' This ultra-cool, downtown-comes-uptown affair is one of the better gallery shows of the year. And full credit goes to its artist-curators, Nate Lowman and Adam McEwen. They've turned Gagosian's six-room space into a mini-museum of objects that speak of the base, the gross, the fallen, the ruined, the failed. A second show, ''Mafia (or One Unopened Packet of Cigarettes),'' is tucked inside. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com; closes today. (Grace Glueck) * LOUISE KRUGER: SCULPTURE, 1950s TO THE PRESENT This 21-work survey of mostly carved wood sculpture supplies another chunk in the history of postwar American art. Influenced by folk art and trained for a year by a shipbuilder, Ms. Kruger developed her art sculpture by cutting woodblocks for prints, as an enormous example here attests. Her life-size figures, portrait busts and political asides are in step with other artists of her generation, including Bill King and Marisol. But her works have their own formal quirks, telling abbreviations, lustrous finishes and quiet, watchful force. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JIM LEE: 'ALTAMONT' This young artist takes tips from lots of approved sources -- Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle and Ellsworth -- but has some ideas of his own about the art and craft of building paintings and the play between the literal and the visual. The smaller works tend to be better because they are more complicated, but on the whole, and as a whole, the show is a beautiful start. Freight & Volume, 542 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-8700, volumegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. It allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory, up close and in detail. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street,(212) 879-0500, closes today. (Smith) NICK Z./KAI ALTHOFF: 'WE ARE BETTER FRIENDS FOR IT' The latest variation on the collaborative trashed-gallery convention is a strikingly beautiful, if funky, cavelike environment punctuated by artfully messy tableaus in stark white containers. These suggest crash pads, children's bedrooms and studios, but also function almost like paintings. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",4fd25d8a8eb7c8105d80c10c,15098

Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) 'ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A' Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'FATE'S IMAGINATION' Sex and politics, a natural combination in real life, don't mesh very well in Randall David Cook's play, but his ear for humor makes this comic drama about a politician's son who has a fling with an older woman pretty entertaining anyway (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. Velina Hasu Houston's play requires the five actresses to portray their characters at every stage of their lives, and it works well that some of them actually are young, while others, like Ako, who plays the uptight, more-Japanese-than-thou Atsuko, are well into middle age. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Off Off Broadway 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Shakespeare imagined many things, yet perhaps even he wouldn't have envisioned this classic tragedy as a musical. The director Ellen Stewart has added many new elements, but the sum remains woefully less than its parts (2:15). LaMaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Claudia La Rocco) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL HER FACES: A PORTRAIT OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD' There's no accounting for fans, as proved by Anthony Inneo's loving but slight tribute to Springfield. If you know the lyrics well enough to sing along, you could do worse than spend an hour listening to some of that English diva's hits, barely packaged in the shape of a play (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C. (the Club), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MAUD, THE MADNESS' The familiarity of many quotations from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson has done nothing to allay my philistine sense of that poet as dated and uneven in quality. This dramatized version of his epic poem ''Maud,'' which he termed a monodrama, does little to dispel such prejudice. Although the actor Jonathan Tindle and the director Niegel Smith have made a prodigious effort to lift Lord Alfred's words off the page, the mad Gothic protagonist they create is unappealing, and his flowery words remain a monument to an aesthetic of another time (1:30). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. ( Midgette) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PHALLACY' Art and science collide in this play by Carl Djerassi, but it's not much of a mash-up; a chemist proves that a curator's prize sculpture has been misdated, and there's not much refuting the evidence (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'rosebud: the lives of orson welles' Cineastes will feel cheated by the Welsh playwright Mark Jenkins's effort to cover all the well-known triumphs and tragedies of this legendary filmmaker's life in under 90 minutes. He walks briskly and rests nowhere long enough. This is a one-man show, and Christian McKay, however, is Welles to the soles of his feet (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'THE FIFTH EMPIRE' (No rating, 127 minutes, in Portuguese) With this stubbornly static, talky drama about a young Portuguese king hoping to unite his troubled nation by embarking on a foreign adventure, the prolific 98-year-old director Manoel de Oliveira pushes his already minimalist style about as far as it can go. At the same time, though, Mr. Olivieira's aesthetic is in sync with his main interest: capturing characters' words and gestures in real time as they work through philosophical and political conundrums while remaining largely oblivious to the physical world around them. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'GRACIE' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Set in New Jersey in 1978, Davis Guggenheim's sensitive underdog tale depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school's all-boy soccer team. While connecting the familiar adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the pickup, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks an unusual degree of emotional complexity. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals LINDSAY ANDERSON'S MICK TRAVIS TRILOGY (Wednesday and Thursday) The British director Lindsay Anderson made three films centered on his everyman character, Mick Travis, played by Malcolm McDowell as a public school rebel in ''If '' (1968), as a disillusioned traveling coffee salesman in ''O Lucky Man!'' (1973) and finally as a hapless victim of the collapsing English health care system in ''Britannia Hospital'' (1982). Anthology Film Archives has managed to assemble all three features for rare sequential screenings -- no easy feat, because each film is controlled by a different company. The screenings begin on Wednesday with ''If '' and ''O Lucky Man!'' and continue on Thursday with ''O Lucky Man!'' and ''Britannia Hospital.'' The films continue in rotation through June 17. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image wraps up its retrospective of the vivid, visceral work of this tabloid reporter turned filmmaker this weekend with screenings of the restored 158-minute version of his World War II epic, ''The Big Red One'' (1980), as well as three rarely shown films from Fuller's late period: ''Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street'' (1972) and ''White Dog'' (1981) tomorrow, and ''Street of No Return'' (1982) on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE SINGER (Monday) A rare showing of Chris Marker's 1974 documentary about the French singer and political activist Yves Montand, presented with two short films by Mr. Marker, ''The Embassy'' (1973) and ''The Sixth Side of the Pentagon'' (1968). BAM Cinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; bam.org; $10. (Kehr) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Today through Thursday) A selection of notable recent Italian films continues tonight with the premiere of Angelo Longoni's ''Caravaggio,'' which stars Alessio Boni (''The Best of Youth'') as the tempestuous painter of the title and features cinematography by another Italian master of light and shadow, Vittorio Storaro. Among the week's other highlights: ''In Memory of Me,'' the second feature of Saverio Costanzo (''Private''), about a young man who enters an island seminary (tomorrow and Wednesday); ''Primo Levi's Journey,'' a documentary by Davide Ferrario that traces Levi's path from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp to his home in Turin (Wednesday and Thursday); and ''See Naples and Die,'' an examination of the city in all of its glory and squalor, directed by Enrico Caria (tomorrow and Monday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * LILY ALLEN (Tuesday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' With Kevin Michael. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. With Santogold. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is with hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tonight at 7, Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776, terrablues.com; $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with Kill Henry Sugar, at the Gershwin Hotel, 7 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (646) 207-0595, gershwinhotel.com; $10. (Sisario) EEF BARZELAY (Wednesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) BOOKER T. AND THE MG'S, SHARON JONES (Wednesday and Thursday) As the house band of Stax Records in the 1960s, Booker T. Jones and his crew had an incalculable role in the creation of Southern soul-funk, mixing musky blues with house-rocking R&B grooves built around the whirr of the organ. Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the vintage Stax sound. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, rivertorivernyc.com; Thursday at noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; both free. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * CARTEL (Tuesday) Those polished, punky riffs and bright singalong choruses straight out of the Blink-182 playbook are not the only signs that this Atlanta band isn't averse to blatant commercialism. Since May 24, Cartel has been inside a giant fiberglass bubble on Pier 54 in Manhattan, recording its second album in a carefully choreographed publicity stunt that involves an MTV reality show and Web tie-ins from Dr Pepper. On Tuesday the band emerges from the bubble and plays a concert on the pier. Presumably Dr Pepper will be on sale. At 6 p.m., Hudson River at 13th Street, West Village, (212) 533-7275, hudsonriverpark.org; free. (Sisario) THE CLIENTELE (Tonight) There's comfort in familiarity, and the soft, sweetly finessed songs by this veteran British indie-cabaret band, with echoes of the Byrds' gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison's breathy calm -- expertly channeled by Alasdair Maclean -- are a seductive sonic cocoon. With Beach House and Pipas. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) COWBOY JUNKIES (Wednesday) Almost 20 years ago this Toronto band released an instant classic with the somber and starkly elegant ''Trinity Session.'' And though on subsequent albums the Cowboy Junkies have never returned to that expressive peak, the delicate interplay between Margo Timmins's velvety alto and her brother Michael Timmins's muted guitar can be chillingly beautiful. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $40. (Sisario) DEFTONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Alternately glum and explosive, this long-running alt-metal band from Sacramento plays tightly compacted guitar riffs as the singer Chino Moreno howls and croons on themes of disintegration and decay. With Dir En Grey and the Fall of Troy. At 7:30, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $27.50 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) DUMPSTAPHUNK (Tonight) The MySpace image for Ivan Neville's new band gives an idea of where it's coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario) * FEIST (Monday and Tuesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the mellow indie-arty scene with deliciously melodic songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; sold out. (Sisario) * HAPPY MONDAYS (Wednesday and Thursday) Working-class hedonists obsessed with the highs of trippy dance music (and with other kinds of highs), Happy Mondays embodied the ''Madchester'' rave-rock scene in Britain of the late 1980s and early '90s. In its latest reincarnation the band plays as the centerpiece of In the City of New York, a two-day conference organized by Tony Wilson, the Factory Records impresario who discovered Happy Mondays, as told in the film ''24 Hour Party People.'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com or inthecityofnewyork.com; $35. (Sisario) LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good. Her band has made a splash at home as much for its smart and catchy new wave update as for Ms. Jackson's vintage skirts and ''Marlene Dietrich-meets-rockabilly chic,'' as one magazine put it. With the Virgins and the King Left. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BERT JANSCH (Sunday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. His appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' and interest from neo-folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart -- who both appear on his latest album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City) -- have introduced him to an appreciative young audience. With P. G. Six and Kevin Barker. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tonight) Founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Trumystic and Quintus. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $17. (Kelefa Sanneh) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to soft-rock's most incestuous hitmakers. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MELT-BANANA (Sunday) The hiccups of guitar and squeals of vocals fly by so fast in the hyperactive music of Melt-Banana, from Japan, that it seems a minor miracle that so many playful pop melodies survive. With Drop Dead and Children. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * NEVILLE BROTHERS (Thursday) Celebrate Brooklyn opens with one of the musical jewels of New Orleans, whose funk lineage stretches back to the 1950s, when the keyboardist Art Neville recorded ''Mardi Gras Mambo'' with the Hawketts. At 5:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) PINK MARTINI (Wednesday) The Hollywood lounge band gone global, this 12-or-so-piece ensemble from Portland, Ore., follows a retro glamour jet stream from Rio to Havana to Paris. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $55. (Sisario) JILL SCOTT (Wednesday and Thursday) Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. The R&B crooner Musiq Soulchild opens on Wednesday; on Thursday the bill is shared by a vocal powerhouse, Chaka Khan, and a current pop hitmaker, Robin Thicke. Mo'Nique is the host of these two shows at Radio City Music Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $69.50 on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Pareles) * STEELY DAN (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) JOSS STONE, COMMON (Today) The self-reinvention pitch behind her third album says that Ms. Stone is over her early phase of imitating 1960s and '70s soul. But on ''Introducing Joss Stone'' (Virgin), this husky-voiced British 20-year-old still holds fast to retro sounds, this time a high-energy soul-funk tinged with hip-hop. Common, the socially conscious rapper from Chicago, will release his seventh album, ''Finding Forever,'' next month, but he's already on the campaign trail, comparing it to the work of Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye. Also on the bill for this benefit for Central Park SummerStage is Ryan Shaw, who, in a smoking version of Wilson Pickett's ''I Found a Love,'' does the soul-revival thing as well as can be done. At 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; $40. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY BAND (Thursday) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Georgie James and Welcome. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Pareles) * RUFUS WAINWRIGHT (Tonight and tomorrow night) There is bad drama and good drama, and nobody does good drama like Rufus Wainwright, who completes a sold-out four-night engagement at the Blender Theater at Gramercy. With Teddy Thompson tonight and Jason Hart tomorrow night. At 8, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Nate Chinen) JAMIE BAUM SEPTET (Tonight) The flutist Jamie Baum favors a carefully organized approach to composition but manages to create ample space for improvisation; a good thing, given that her ensemble here consists of Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Douglas Yates on alto saxophone and bass clarinet, Vincent Chancey on French horn, Vijay Iyer on piano, Boris Kozlov on bass and Jeff Hirshfield on drums. At 8, Neighborhood Church of Greenwich Village, 269 Bleecker Street, at Morton Street, West Village, (212) 691-1770, ncgv.com; free.

At 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $25, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS/BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- suits their modern sort of chamber jazz. Brooklyn Qawwali Party, which plays a later set, uses a more percussive assortment of instruments to create its caffeinated take on the Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. At 7 and 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen) * TRIBUTE TO OSCAR PETERSON: MASTER OF SWING (Tonight) This legendary pianist, now in his 80s, won't personally preside over this tribute, but that's no reason to overlook an embarrassment of riches that includes the pianists Hank Jones, Billy Taylor and Marian McPartland; the trumpeters Clark Terry and Wynton Marsalis; and the singers Dee Dee Bridgewater and Freddy Cole. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $66. (Chinen) * RANDY WESTON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer, he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions, as he demonstrates best with his longstanding African Rhythms ensembles. His program here is intended as a tribute to the composer James Reese Europe. At 7:30, Harlem Stage at the Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $35.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera, and offers Verdi with all of that love, so that some of the spirit of the opera comes across almost in spite of the variable skills of its performers. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) MET IN THE PARKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Opera companies are always drumming up new ways to attract a big audience. But the crowds that flock, picnic in tow, to New York city parks for the Metropolitan Opera's annual outdoor summer performances seem to need little enticement. This month the Met is offering ''La Bohème'' and ''Faust.'' At ''Bohème'' on Tuesday, Gareth Morrell conducts Hei-Kyung Hong as Mimì, Mary Dunleavy as Musetta, Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo, Dwayne Croft as Marcello, Jeff Mattsey as Schaunard and Andrew Gangestad as Colline. For ''Faust'' on Wednesday, Maurizio Benini conducts David Pomeroy in the title role, Katie Van Kooten as Marguerite, Kate Lindsey as Siébel, Hung Yun as Valentin and James Morris as Méphistophélès. At 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Vivien Schweitzer) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday) Romanticism and early Modernism are on the agenda at this floating concert hall this week. Tonight Dmitry Alexeev devotes his piano recital to Beethoven's Sonatas Nos. 5 and 32, as well as to works by Chopin, and Beethoven has the stage to himself in a chamber program on Wednesday that includes the Septet (Op. 20) as its centerpiece. Tomorrow afternoon Julia Zilberquit plays piano music by Liadov, Medtner, Rachmaninoff and Tcherepnin, and tomorrow evening and on Sunday afternoon, Dmitry and Anya Alexeev pick up this Russian thread in a program of piano works by Balakirev, Liadov and Medtner, with a piano four-hands version of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' as its conclusion. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and on Thursday. (Allan Kozinn) CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) This annual three-week feast of early music, slightly spare yet charming in the best New England tradition, begins this weekend with what you could call song and dance. Tonight the vocal trio Liber Unusualis performs mystical songs from the 14th and 15th centuries; on Sunday Vivaldi's complete ''Estro Armonico,'' a groundbreaking sequence of 12 concerti, will be performed in the original chamber instrumentation. Tonight at 8, Enders Island Chapel, Mason's Island, Mystic; Sunday at 6 p.m., Christ the King Church, Old Lyme, (860) 444-2419, ctearlymusic.org; $20 to $26. (Midgette) * DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tonight) The innovative Da Capo Chamber Ensemble concludes its 36th season with ''Sonic Brew,'' a lively program of contemporary works featuring David Lang's ''Sweet Air''; Randall Woolf's ''No Luck, No Happiness''; Beth May's ''Gloaming''; Jefferson Friedman's ''78''; Jacob ter Veldhuis's ''Grab It!''; John Halle's ''Free People''; and Marc Mellits's ''Spam.'' At 7:30, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com or dacapochamberplayers.org; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) For their Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, these superb musicians are presenting a complete cycle of the Beethoven quartets, but in a much larger framework. These seminal works are being performed alongside pieces by composers from Bach to Kaija Saariaho, whose ''Terra Memoria'' has been commissioned especially for this occasion. Sunday's program juxtaposes Beethoven's ''Harp'' and ''Serioso'' Quartets with works by Anton Webern and Bartok's teeming Third Quartet. The Emerson, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this series, sounded in top form for the first concert. The one drawback is Carnegie Hall, which for all its acoustical glory, is not an ideal space for an intimate string quartet experience. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Anthony Tommasini) * ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tomorrow) Earlier this year Carnegie Hall, the Weill Music Institute and the Juilliard School jointly instituted a visionary program to train outstanding young musicians on the verge of professional careers and integrate them into the music programs of selected New York City public schools. The emerging artists have been showcased this spring in several concerts at Carnegie Hall. The next one is tomorrow night, an exciting and ambitious program with large-scale works by Webern, Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and John Adams (the Chamber Symphony). But the sponsors should strongly consider coming up with a better name for this talented roster of players. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org, $15. (Tommasini) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Tonight) This weeklong program of instruction, lectures and concerts, which ends on Sunday, has been dealing mainly with Beethoven's chamber music. Tonight's faculty concert offers the Piano Trio in D from Op. 70; the Piano Sonata in E (Op. 109), with Claude Frank; and the Brentano String Quartet playing the late E flat Quartet (Op. 127). At 8, Mannes College the New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes/bi; $20. (Bernard Holland) NEW YORK PHILARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) Riccardo Muti may not be coming to the Philharmonic as music director, but he does drop by periodically, and he is doing so right now. Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday, music by Cherubini and Hindemith frames a performance of Beethoven's ''Emperor'' Concerto with the pianist Lang Lang providing the flash. Mr. Muti reappears with a new program of Rossini, Schubert and Dvorak on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $38 to $106. (Holland) * St. Luke'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Unbound'' is the title of the second program in ''Notable Women,'' St. Luke's chamber festival celebrating female composers. It denotes women who have sufficiently freed themselves of the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains around 80 percent male -- to achieve success. They include Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen and Joan Tower, who has organized the whole festival as a way to promote discussion and, on a practical level, a new burst of ''old-girl'' networking. The first performance of a commissioned work by Kati Agócs is also on the program. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; Sunday at 3 p.m.,Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org; $20. (Midgette) WESTERN WIND (Tonight) This vocal ensemble has performed an enormous repertory over the years, from ancient to modern works, with occasional excursions into pop and theater music offsetting their more typical classical programs. Its current program is all contemporary music, and includes the world premiere of ''Basket Rondo,'' written for the group by Meredith Monk. Scores by Philip Glass, Tania León, William Bolcom, Robert Dennis, Matthew Harris, Eric Salzman, Gayla D. Morgan and one of the ensemble's singers, Elliot Z. Levine, are also included. At 8, Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 873-2848, westernwind.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) * Food for Thought (Tonight through Sunday night) Downtown dance performances can feel as if they happen in a bubble, but this weekend you can have your art and be an activist too, as Food for Thought features three evenings organized by Irene Hultman, Jonah Bokaer and Gina Gibney. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $5 with two cans of food, or $10.

At 7 p.m., Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron district, (917) 606-8200, yumuseum.org; $8; $6 for students and 65+.

(La Rocco) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The big news is the premiere tonight of Christopher Wheeldon's new work ''The Nightingale and the Rose,'' set to music by Bright Sheng, the company's resident composer, and starring Wendy Whelan, Sara Mearns and Tyler Angle. Tonight's program, ''Tradition and Innovation,'' also includes Peter Martins's ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' '' and, oddly, the Rosenkavalier section of ''Vienna Waltzes,'' by George Balanchine. Other programs are the ''one-time-only'' combination of Mr. Wheeldon's new ballet, Balanchine's ''Union Jack'' and ''Rubies'' from Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' danced for the first time by Megan Fairchild and the delicious Joaquin De Luz.

(Dunning) JODY OBERFELDER DANCE PROJECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.''

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE MET: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in work he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman) THE NATIONAL ACADEMY: '182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,' through July 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative -- or ''traditional,'' if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Summer of Love: Art of the PsychedElic Era,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' By now some of the freewheeling, sometimes prankish specimens of photography styled Conceptual, rampant in the '60s and '70s, have become classics, as this wide-ranging show proves. The more than 35 projects on view, drawn from a private collection, include works by many of the usual suspects: Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Giuseppe Penone, John Baldessari and Charles Ray. Among those on display here that have stood the test of time are Nauman's witty explorations of his body, like ''Self-Portrait as Fountain'' (1966); Ray's ''Plank Piece I, II'' (1973), in which he helps a board make sculpture of his body; and Penone's ''To Reverse One's Eyes'' (1970), embellishing his sight through lenses made of mirrors. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through June 23. (Glueck) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, through June 15. (Glueck) 'SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT' This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters -- who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery -- dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo's ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden's ''Number 1'' (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through June 15. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street * PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn't think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism's fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism's pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector's beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through June 23. (Smith) Marc Quinn: 'Sphinx' This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society's obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: SoHo TINA BARNEY: CHINA VISIT Tina Barney's last series of photographs featured a nearly extinct species, the European aristocracy, while her new works look to China. Most of the photographs feature members of the creative class, from actors and dancers to a jingle composer, although several juxtapose the ''old'' China with the ''new,'' Westernized version, seen through the filter of opera performers or female golf caddies posed against an urban backdrop. These are more posed and less intimate than Ms. Barney's photographs of her own upper-crust East Coast tribe, which made her famous in the 1980s. But the implications of this project are obvious, with China's growing position on the world's political and economic stages. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, www.janetbordeninc.com; through June 16. (Schwendener) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS bilder Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) Last Chance JOAQUÍN TORRES-GARCÍA: 'paintings and drawings, 1920-1942' This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-García ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' . This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190; closes today. (Smith) MARGUERITE ZORACH: A LIFE IN ART The first solo show in more than 30 years of a pioneer of European modernism in America contains 35 paintings -- landscapes, portraits and still lifes -- ranging in date from 1910 to the mid-1960s. They're not all equally good, but they all have a quality of grit, intelligence and striving that never falters. The next show should also include her textiles and works on paper. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, www.gpgallery.com; closes today. (Smith)",4fd25d898eb7c8105d80c016,15333

Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'ESSENTIAL SELF-DEFENSE' Adam Rapp's new play is a quirky love story about a wholesome but anxious girl (the charming Heather Goldenhersh) and an automaton with a beating heart and a big vocabulary (Paul Sparks, impressively affectless). Dark, zany, entirely mannered and mostly empty (2:15). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LA MAGNANI' Theresa Gambacorta reincarnates the Italian film star in this one-woman show, which reveals her to be more irritating than interesting -- loud and self-absorbed. Ms. Gambacorta does, however, get some pathos out of her relationship to her son, who had polio (1:10). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00).

Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.

(Lawrence Van Gelder) Last Chance 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cockfighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer.

This sweet, nostalgic solo show explores the life and work of the controversial Scottish psychiatrist -- an international celebrity and countercultural guru in the 1960s -- from the perspective of a genial admirer. It's well acted and empathetic but a bit too pleasantly tranquil to bring such a prickly and passionately disputed figure into full focus (1:30).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis) * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'AMERICAN CANNIBAL' (No rating, 91 minutes) Illustrating the premise that if you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas, the documentary about a failed reality television series is absorbing in the same sick way as the lowest examples of the genre it examines. (Stephen Holden) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. The movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofor, among others. , as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Holden) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'THE HAWK IS DYING' (No rating, 106 minutes) In this painfully earnest backwoods tale from the director Julian Goldberger, Paul Giamatti plays George Gattling, a dispirited auto upholsterer with a passion for falconry. Set in Central Florida and based on the book by Harry Crews, ''The Hawk Is Dying'' is a dreary study of male angst groaning beneath the weight of its own symbolism. Not since Ken Loach's ''Kes'' has a bird of prey carried so much dramatic responsibility. (Catsoulis) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (A. O. Scott) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) 'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz) * 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'SACCO AND VANZETTI' (No rating, 81 minutes) This feature filmmaking debut by Peter Miller, a PBS veteran, hews to standard television documentary format: archival photographs and talking heads. But the movie's meat-and-potatoes style seems less a failure of imagination than a means of putting in the foreground its subject matter: the still-controversial tale of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Italian immigrants and outspoken anarchists charged with the 1920 robbery of a Massachusetts shoe factory and the murder of two of its employees. A good film on a great subject. (Seitz) 'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis) * 'U-CARMEN' (No rating, 120 minutes, in Xhosa) Winner of the top award at the 2005 Berlin Film Festival, ''U-Carmen'' pushes against every expectation you would normally bring to a movie version of Bizet's opera. It relocates the tale's doomed romantic triangle to Khayelitsha, an industrial community near Cape Town, South Africa; sets the action in and around a cigarette factory; and translates its libretto into Xhosa, a regional language distinguished by its abundance of pops and clicks. For the most part, the film's action is intentionally plain, always acknowledging its physical environment, which can be frustrating when the melodies soar. But the music still pierces, the blood still flows, and the overall conception is so original that even when the movie falters in the moment, it dazzles in the memory. (Seitz) Film Series 'BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ' (Tuesday through April 15) Rainer Werner Fassbinder made this 13-part adaptation of the grueling social realist novel by Alfred Doblin for West German television in 1980, but because the film was shot on 16 millimeter, it has been in fragile condition and out of sight for many years. But now the Fassbinder Foundation, with the support of the Museum of Modern Art, has completed a restoration, transferring the original 16-millimeter negative to 35 millimeter. Gunter Lamprecht stars as the downtrodden hero, a Weimer everyman struggling to keep his stomach full and his dignity intact. Parts 1 through 3 will be shown on Tuesday; 4 through 7 on Wednesday; 8 through 11 on Thursday; and 12, 13 and the epilogue on April 13. (The film will also be repeated in two parts on April 14 and 15.) This screening is part of a three-week series of Fassbinder films from MoMA's collection, which this week will include ''Despair'' (tonight), ''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (tomorrow), ''Jail Bait'' (tomorrow) and ''Whity'' (Sunday). On Monday, Juliane Lorenz, Fassbinder's longtime editor, will introduce two documentaries, ''Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz: Notes on the Restoration'' and ''A Mega Movie and Its Story.'' Mr. Lamprecht and one of his co-stars, Barbara Sukowa, are expected to attend. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) FARES TO REMEMBER: TAXI '07 (Today through Sunday) The IFC Center celebrates the 100th anniversary of the taxi in New York City with a month of cab-centric movies. This Friday and Sunday at noon, Harold Lloyd stars in the silent comedy ''Speedy,'' in which one of his duties as a New York cabbie is getting Babe Ruth to the stadium on time. At midnight on Friday and Saturday, Robert De Niro plays a less accommodating chauffeur in Martin Scorsese's dark, expressionist ''Taxi Driver'' (1976). IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) THE REAL EDIE SEDGWICK (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image concludes a survey of the film work of this Warhol superstar, society figure and all-around study in self-destructiveness with several rarely shown Warhol films, including ''Kitchen,'' ''Restaurant,'' ''Afternoon'' (made from outtakes from ''Chelsea Girls''), ''Beauty #2'' and ''Horse,'' all from 1965. There's also a pair of non-Warhol efforts: ''Poem Posters,'' a 1967 documentary by Charles Henri Ford in which Sedgwick appears among the downtown celebrities at an art opening, and the 1972 ''Ciao, Manhattan,'' a semi-autobiographical feature completed just weeks before Sedgwick's death. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Tomorrow) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubble-gum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys in February, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300, nassaucoliseum.com; $55 to $95. (Ben Sisario) * LILY ALLEN, THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Wednesday) A 21-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' The Bird and the Bee, a well-dressed duo from Los Angeles, toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums. This show inaugurates the newly renamed Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza. At 8:40 p.m., 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Tonight through Sunday) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater, ending this weekend. At 8, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $54.99 to $94.99. (Sisario) BLUE CHEER, AN ALBATROSS (Tomorrow) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960s and early '70s, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the band sound like cave men discovering fire. An Albatross, from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., shrieks its way through dizzying but lighthearted prog-hardcore songs that borrow something from Captain Beefheart. At 8 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) CÉU (Monday and Tuesday) With an easy, dragging beat, bossa nova becomes something like light dub in the lithe and playful songs of Céu, a young woman from São Paulo who is rising fast in the Brazilian circuit. Monday at 9:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) * COLD WAR KIDS, TOKYO POLICE CLUB (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday nights) The craggy guitars and piano, elliptical songwriting and verge-of-a-breakdown vocals of Cold War Kids, from Long Beach, Calif., may be par for the indie-rock course. But if the band's three sold-out shows this week at the Bowery Ballroom are any indication, it is still basking in the microfame bestowed over the last year by zealous bloggers. Tonight and tomorrow night, Cold War Kids play with Tokyo Police Club, a Canadian group that spikes Strokes-like songs with noisy petulance. At 9, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com. Tokyo Police Club also plays Monday at 10 p.m. at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) JOÃO DONATO (Tonight) Mr. Donato is one of the great bossa nova composers of the late-'50s generation, and probably the one most influenced by American jazz; his performances these days are nostalgic and sometimes anarchically funny. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Ben Ratliff) * IGGY AND THE STOOGES (Monday) Suffice it to say that ''The Weirdness'' (Virgin), the first Stooges album in 34 years, is not likely to become a classic. But as with every one of Iggy Pop's many mediocre solo albums over the years, any excuse to keep him on the road is worthwhile. Even nearing 60, he remains an inspirationally feral performer, and on past tours the reunited Stooges have ably summoned some of the raw, menacing groove that made them one of the primary godfathers of punk rock. With Sistas in the Pit. At 7 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; $39.50 to $59.50. (Sisario) JUNIOR BOYS (Wednesday) When dance music goes sad: squiggly, awkward beats and droopy keyboards surround the forlorn vocals of this Canadian electronic group, who sing about missed birthdays and phones that don't ring. With San Serac and TigerCity. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) KAISER CHIEFS, WALKMEN (Thursday) Gracefully but not always excitingly, the Kaiser Chiefs, from Leeds, England, mingle the spunky minimalism of XTC-vintage post-punk with the ballad-friendly melodicism of '90s Britpop. The Walkmen, from New York, play exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. With the Annuals. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $31 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * KLAXONS (Tuesday) This British trio's eerie rave-punk is punctuated by the peal of air-raid sirens and paranoid, shouted lyrics that allude to William S. Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon. How the band manages to cram in such fear and loathing and still make exhilarating, danceable grooves is what makes it fascinating. With Bonde do Role, a Brazilian baile-funk group that makes silly but contagiously high-energy electronic pastiches. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) SONDRE LERCHE (Tomorrow) A 24-year-old Norwegian with a kind tenor and a light touch, Mr. Lerche plays elegant, melodically rich but sometimes overly coy folk-pop. With Willy Mason and Thomas Dybdahl. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO HALL AND OATES (Thursday) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Hall and Oates, whose mega-selling soul-pop ranged from the sublime (''She's Gone'') to the farcical (''Portable Radio''). At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) LOW; LONEY, DEAR (Tonight) With exquisite care, Low, from Duluth, Minn., featuring the husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk on guitar and Mimi Parker on vocals, and Matt Livingston on bass, creates hushed, stark songs on a vast sonic scale. Loney, Dear, led by the Swedish songwriter Emil Svanangen, plays placid folk-pop decorated with endearing, '60s-style harmonies. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) PARTS AND LABOR (Tonight) This squally Brooklyn three-piece ably pulls off the tricky task of being both anarchic and anthemic. With Big Bear, Gowns and Alex Delivery. At 8:30, Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $10. (Sisario) PEEPING TOM (Monday) The latest project of Mike Patton, the naughty boy of heavy metal turned naughty boy of the avant-garde. The gimmick here is creepy lounge and trip-hop, with various collaborators in on the joke. For this show the guests are Dan the Automator, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto and the rapper Pigeon John. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) PRETTY RICKY (Tomorrow) This R&B boy band from Miami has hit the top of the charts with amorous crooning -- and some rapping -- that drops flirtatious pretense in pursuit of the girl and cuts right to the chase: ''Can I put a little peer pressure on ya?'' At 7 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $29.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. With the Bowmans. At 9, Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $20.50. (Jon Pareles) DIANA ROSS (Tonight) In her guest performance on ''American Idol'' last month, Ms. Ross showed that at 63 she remains every bit the ''dreamgirl'': breezing her way through the Spiral Starecase song ''More Today Than Yesterday,'' she was smooth, cocky and in love with her own voice -- a true superstar. At 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $59.50 to $149.50. (Sisario) MARTIN SEXTON (Tonight) This singer and songwriter can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, Mr. Sexton can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. With Jonah Smith. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $30. (Pareles) STONE SOUR, SHADOWS FALL, LACUNA COIL (Tonight) Stone Sour, featuring Corey Taylor of the horror-metal crew Slipknot, leads a strong bill of angry guitars and punishing drums. Slipknot is indiscriminate in its misanthropy, but in the poppier Stone Sour, Mr. Taylor chooses his targets more carefully, including some not-so-veiled political ones: ''We're more in danger than before you took power.'' At 7:20, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800 roselandballroom.com; $34. (Sisario) * KOKO TAYLOR (Tonight) For five decades Ms. Taylor, 71, has sung brawny, carnal blues like ''Wang Dang Doodle'' with a strength and swagger rivaling that of any man. After a health crisis a few years ago, she has returned with a new album, ''Old School'' (Alligator), in which she shows that her ego remains as strong as her voice: ''You don't want to tangle with me,'' she sings. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35. (Sisario) TEDDYBEARS (Monday) This Swedish band has one of the year's bigger head-scratchers with ''Punkrocker,'' a paranoid jaunt with new-wave synthesizers and a deadpan vocal by Iggy Pop that is being used in a Cadillac ad -- makes perfect sense, right? With Foreign Islands. At 7 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $14.50 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario) WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY (Tomorrow) The World/Inferno Friendship Society's ''red-eyed soul'' is a raucous mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B.

(Chinen) * RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET / DAVID SÁNCHEZ QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Ravi Coltrane and David Sánchez are two of the more assertively creative tenor saxophonists to emerge within the jazz mainstream in the last dozen or so years, and each has a knack for organizing rhythmically sophisticated working bands.

(Chinen) SONNY FORTUNE TRIO (Tomorrow) Since the 1960s, countless saxophonists have adopted the methodology of John Coltrane, but few have captured his restless spirit.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766, sistasplace.org; cover, $20. (Chinen) BILL FRISELL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) On his last two trio releases, both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard, the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook.

At 10, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) PAT MARTINO (Tonight through Sunday) A powerfully proficient guitarist, Mr. Martino favors a brand of post-bop that has more than a little in common with the blistering fusion of his youth. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MODERN ROMANCE: IGOR BUTMAN AND IGOR RAYKHELSON (Tomorrow) Mr. Butman is a saxophonist and one of Russia's top jazz musicians, and Mr. Raykhelson is a pianist and composer equally drawn to jazz and classical music. Performing here with musicians including the violinist Elena Revich and the cellist Boris Andrianov, they advance a crossover ideal.

(Chinen) * THELONIOUS MONK 90TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) A premature celebration, perhaps -- Thelonious Monk was born in October -- but a thoughtfully programmed one, involving a pianist deeply familiar with Monkish expression (Kenny Barron) and a repertory band led by one of Monk's former drummers (Ben Riley's Monk Legacy Septet). As a bonus, the actor Rome Neal will revisit his role in ''Monk'' (the one-man play, not the television show). At 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $30, $27.50 for students.

At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen) MISHA PIATIGORSKY (Wednesday) On his new album, ''Uncommon Circumstance'' (Mishamusic), the pianist Misha Piatigorsky plays original music informed both by classical and groove-based music, with impressive but sometimes airless results.

At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'DIE ÄGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tomorrow) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth, has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Mr. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra. The German tenor Torsten Kerl sings Menelas. This is the final performance of the season. At 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's swashbuckling verismo opera, in the Met's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role, a poet with libertarian fervor during the French Revolution. But in his honest and compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana as Maddalena and the powerful baritone Mark Delavan as Gérard are very strong. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $320 tomorrow, $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tomorrow) Rossini's sleek, simple and lovely take on Sir Walter Scott is ending its run at the New York City Opera. Elena, the Donna in question, is sung by Alexandrina Pendatchanska. The two high-flying tenor parts are taken by Barry Banks as Uberto and Andrew Drost as Rodrigo. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Bernard Holland) 'CURLEW RIVER' (Thursday) Britten called his one-act opera ''Curlew River'' a church parable. Inspired by a Japanese Noh play, the work takes the form of a sacred ritual, with a procession of monks enacting a mystery play about a madwoman who crosses a river with a ferryman in search of her abducted son. The Japan Society offers a staging of this haunting and seldom-seen work, a co-production with the L'Opéra Rouen/Haute-Normandie directed by Yoshi Oida, starring the tenor Michael Bennett as the madwoman, with musical direction by David Stern. At 7:30 p.m., 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $52; $45 for members. (Tommasini) 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera joins a big week for Handel opera with the first ''Giulio Cesare'' of the season. David Daniels and Ruth Ann Swenson are in principal roles, and Harry Bicket conducts. At 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $320 tickets remaining tonight, $15 to $175 for Tuesday. (Holland) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) New principals take over the City Opera's current run of Puccini's inspired tearjerker. Shu-Ying Li is Cio-Cio-San and Christopher Jackson is Pinkerton. Atsushi Yamada is the new conductor. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Wednesday) The stylishly realistic production of Verdi's ''Traviata'' created by the soprano Renata Scotto for the New York City Opera returns to the repertory. Making her company debut as Violetta is the French soprano Anne-Sophie Duprels, who has won high praise for her portrayal of the role in London and other cities. The tenor Bruce Sledge sings Alfredo. George Manahan conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Monday) For spectacle and big music, the Franco Zeffirelli production at the Met of Puccini's final opera is hard to beat. For compelling leads, you might have to look elsewhere: Andrea Gruber sounded wobbly and thin on the first night of this revival, and Richard Margison effort-full, though he marshaled his forces for ''Nessun dorma.'' Only Hei-Kyung Hong's Liu, with her reliably floating pianos, was really worth the price of admission. But spectacle and size are evidently enough to keep tickets selling briskly for this one. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Monday and Wednesday) William Kentridge, the South African art-world star, is an animator, a draughtsman and a man of the theater. After a range of smaller-scale works -- the puppet operas ''Zeno at 4 a.m.'' and ''Il Ritorno di Ulisse in Patria'' were both seen at Lincoln Center in recent years -- he took on Mozart's final opera for the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Belgium in 2005. Set in a Victorian age of exploration, with antic animations, the resulting production (conducted by an assistant of René Jacobs, who led the original) comes to Brooklyn for four performances through next weekend. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $110. (Midgette) Classical Music 'ABSOLUTE ARABIAN NIGHTS' (Tomorrow) Conceived by Kristjan Jarvi, the adventurous young conductor who founded the hip Absolute Ensemble, and the Swiss-born composer Daniel Schnyder, ''Absolute Arabian Nights'' is, the presenters state, a classical, jazz and ethnic music fusion of the sights and spirit of the Middle East. This ensemble's guests for this timely program include Marcel Khalife on oud and vocals, Bachar Khalife on hand percussion and Bassam Saba on nay. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $37.50 and $40.

He will perform new works for voice and various instruments, including William Duckworth's ''Their Song'' for baritone and piano. Petr Kotik conducts the New York premiere of Christian Wolff's ''37 Haiku'' for baritone, oboe, horn, viola and cello, and the world premiere of ''A People's History'' by R. Chris Dahlgren for baritone, flute, clarinet, percussion, piano, celeste, violin and cello.

Sandwiched between these two extroverted works is the New York premiere of Richard Danielpour's introverted ''River of Light,'' written in memory of Isaac Stern. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to 79. (Schweitzer) COLLEGIUM VOCALE GENT (Sunday) Whatever your religious persuasions, for a music lover there is no better way to spend Easter Sunday than listening to the Collegium Vocale Gent under Philippe Herreweghe perform Bach's ''St. John Passion.'' The ensembles (both chorus and orchestra) are first-rate, the music breathtaking, the soloists (including Camilla Tilling and Christoph Prégardien as the Evangelist) reliable: superlatives fail us. Just go. At 3 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $60. (Midgette) CUTTING EDGE ENSEMBLE (Monday) The conductor and composer Victoria Bond is the host of a series of concerts that bring together music and other art forms -- in this case, weaving and digital art. Pamela Topham's ''Water Music,'' a tapestry inspired by the East Hampton landscape, will be paired with Libby Larsen's ''Slow Structures,'' a composition inspired by water as it freezes. Judith Shatin's ''Penelope's Song,'' for cello and electronics, uses the sounds of a weaver's loom. And Kenji Bunch's ''Crawl Space,'' ''Sarabande'' and ''The 3 G's'' will be accompanied by video of digital painting and animation. At 8 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $15; $10 for students.

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $90. (Kozinn) * JERUSALEM STRING QUARTET (Thursday) This young ensemble played a memorable concert at the 92nd Street Y last season in which it framed a Brahms Piano Quintet with American and Israeli works. The group's program at Zankel Hall looks more cautious -- the repertory is Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 18, No. 1), Janacek's gritty ''Kreutzer Sonata'' Quartet, and Tchaikovsky's Quartet No. 1 -- but presumably these musicians play this works with the same electricity that enlivened their performance last year. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Kozinn) WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR AND HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Monday) Hot on the heels of their exploration of the songs of Hugo Wolf, Mr. Holzmair, a baritone, and Ms. Haselböck, a mezzo-soprano (both excellent Austrian singers), turn their attention to the songs of Franz Schreker, a major opera composer of the early 20th century whose music was branded ''degenerate'' by the Nazis. The event is offered in tandem with the American premiere of Schreker's 1910 opera, ''Der Ferne Klang,'' in a concert performance by the American Symphony Orchestra and Leon Botstein. At 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; acfny.com; free, but reservations are required. (Schweitzer) MIKLOS PERENYI AND ANDRAS SCHIFF (Wednesday and Thursday) Two distinguished Hungarians, the cellist Mr. Perenyi and his friend the pianist Mr. Schiff, take on Beethoven's cello and piano repertory with back-to-back concerts at the 92nd Street Y. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $45. (Holland) NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday and Thursday) Latin song has become a great passion among the many wide-ranging passions of Steven Blier, the polymathic co-founder, co-director, accompanist and speaker of the New York Festival of Song. ''Amores Nuevos'' is a new program of music by Alberto Hemsi, Maria Grever, Gisela Hernández and many other composers one will probably be glad to have heard of at evening's end. Michelle Areyzaga, Jeffrey Picon and Ricardo Herrera are the soloists. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $48. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) This week's focus is on Shostakovich's first violin concerto, introduced by Peter Schickele at an ''Inside the Music'' event on Wednesday, performed by Lisa Batiashvili with the conductor Sakari Oramo on that night and Thursday. For Mr. Oramo, however, another highlight is his compatriot Sibelius's Sixth Symphony: the rising star, who successfully succeeded Simon Rattle in Birmingham, is recording a complete Sibelius cycle. Wednesday at 6:45 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $60 for Wednesday, $28 to $94 for Thursday. (Midgette) * POMERIUM (Tomorrow) Alexander Blachly leads his superb choir in a program of Renaissance Passion and Resurrection motets for Easter. Among the composers represented in this broadly international program are Dufay, Gesualdo, Monteverdi, Senfl, Lassus and Byrd. At 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290, metmuseum.org; $35. (Kozinn) ILYA YAKUSHEV (Tomorrow) Ilya Yakushev, the winner of the 2005 World Piano Competition in Cincinnati, is a graduate of Mannes College of Music and currently studies with Vladimir Feltsman. Mr. Yakushev, a 25-year-old native of St. Petersburg, Russia, has been executive director of the International Keyboard Institute and Festival at Mannes since 2002. In his Alice Tully recital debut, he will play Haydn's Sonata in D (Hob. XVI:37), Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7 (''War Sonata 2/Stalingrad'') and Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $20. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AILEY II (Wednesday and Thursday) Alvin Ailey created a second, or junior, company in 1974, almost casually, as a way of working on new choreography. Ailey II is now a world-class troupe, filled with dancers who not only are good but also perform with a youthful hunger for their art, along with a reverence for dance that is a part of the mission of the company director, Sylvia Waters, whom Ailey himself chose to direct that first group. Now Ailey II is coming home, performing in the black-box theater that is part of the Ailey headquarters -- newer, grander and more gleaming than Ailey ever envisioned. The repertory will include new dances by Abdel Salaam, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Jessica Lang, along with Ailey's ''Streams'' and a chunk of Ailey highlights. (Through April 22.) At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444, alvinailey.org; $40; $10 student rush tickets available. (Jennifer Dunning) * 'THE ART OF FALLING' (Thursday) This free performance-installation, choreographed by Catherine Hourihan with video by Pam Kray, juxtaposes live dancers' bodies with projected images of New York City and its architecture to suggest the inherent fragility of solid, everyday life in the 21st century. (Through April 20.) The installation alone will be visible April 13 to 20. At 7:30 p.m., Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Swing Space, 15 Nassau Street, between Cedar and Pine Streets, Lower Manhattan, (877) 919-8326, chourihan.com (Dunning) JONAH BOKAER AND LIUBO BORRISOV (Monday through Thursday) If you find yourself in Chelsea this month, hop into Dance Theater Workshop to see if there's ''A Cure for Surveillance.'' This public media piece, by Jonah Bokaer and Liubo Borrisov, marks the workshop's new Gallery Installation Fellowship. (Through April 28.) During theater hours; Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; free. (Claudia La Rocco) JOHN BUTLER: AN AMERICAN MASTER (Tuesday through Thursday) John Butler's dances have been performed by companies from Australia to Canada. Next week, several of the late choreographer's works will get a new look by some artists closer to home, including Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Richmond Ballet and Desmond Richardson. (Through April 14.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (La Rocco) DANCE AT DNA (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Ellis Wood and her all-female modern-dance company perform Ms. Wood's new ''Flat Affect,'' a piece about women's irrational fears. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tami Stronach Dance follows on Thursday, through April 15, in Ms. Stronach's ''Pinchas the Fisher-People and the Great Flood.'' This retelling of the ancient myth, set to klezmer music, is from the perspective of mermaids. Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning) 'DANCE CONVERSATIONS AT THE FLEA' (Tuesday) This free series of performing and discussion continues with work by Sasha Welsh, Roxanne Steinberg, Jackie Moynahan and HoffTanzt/Daniela Hoff, all chosen by Yasuko Yokoshi. At 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 645-6462, theflea.org.

At 8, Location One, 26 Greene Street, Manhattan, (212) 334-3347, location1.org; $20. (Dunning) * AMANDA LOULAKI AND SHORT MEAN LADY (Thursday through Sunday) In ''Delirium, or That Taste in My Mouth,'' the Crete-born choreographer Amanda Loulaki and her collaborators explore the choices people make in their bodies, before the mind can fully weigh in -- and given the bodies in question, these should be some captivating decisions indeed. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (La Rocco) MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH (Monday) Carrie Ahern, Jeffrey Peterson and Sasha Welsh investigate works in progress in the latest installment of this terrific series.

Mr. Zustiak's company is back in business now, with a new work that ponders death and confrontations with mortality. (Through April 15.) At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School but one of its less dramatic painters, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin, rather than the metaphorical view held by Cole and other Hudson River artists that its representation ought to express God's sublimity. Obeying Ruskin's call for truth to nature, Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand's weaknesses -- repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists -- it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'FAMILY PICTURES,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents awkwardly posing against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * MOMA: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * NEUE GALERIE: 'VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbarán's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the pièce de résistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. He also sautéed a Polaroid of a Christmas tree in grease. The copy he sent to Robert Smithson, golden brown on the outside, is here too, and none too appetizing, I might add. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you're as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through tomorrow. (Smith) Galleries: Other 'GIFTS OF THE FOREST: NATIVE TRADITIONS IN WOOD AND BARK' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) * 'EARLY CHINESE BUDDHIST SCULPTURE,' Asia Week is over, but its essence lingers on in this exhibition of beautiful carved stone figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dating from the Northern Wei to Tang periods in China. This is the type of work that elicited rapturous responses when shown in London and Washington a few seasons back. Throckmorton Fine Art, 145 East 57th Street, third floor, (212) 223-1059, through April 14. (Cotter) Last Chance * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,' through Sunday. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The strongest concentration is in Italian drawings. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. (See above.) (Schwendener) * JOHANNES VANDERBEEK The debut solo show of this artist at is a poetic, storybook tableau with a full-scale sculpture of a medieval knight reclining on his tomb and a walled-up archway set in the gallery wall. Both are made of papier-mâché made from old copies of Time and National Geographic. The beautiful little tree that stands between them is also of paper and paste. And check out the time-and-space-warped sleepers in the back room. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",4fd2575d8eb7c8105d801ede,15546

The 14th Street Theater, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' In previews; opens on March 29. Vanessa Redgrave stars in this adaptation of Joan Didion's heartbreaking memoir. David Hare directs (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'THE ATTIC' The playwright Yoji Sakate looks at hikikomori, the Japanese phenomenon in which teenagers retreat from society, isolating themselves for weeks, months and sometimes even years. With a deft ensemble cast, the results are illuminating, original and darkly funny. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combatting addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'KING LEAR' Or ''Lear Lite,'' featuring New Age music; eye-soothing, color-coordinated costumes; and the charming Kevin Kline in the title role. Directed by James Lapine, this is a whimsical story-book production that feels perversely out of touch with the soul-wrenching depths of Shakespeare's most devastating tragedy (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie wrote this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467. (Kalb) 'MOBY DICK -- REHEARSED' A gripping revival of Orson Welles's 1955 adaptation of Melville's classic (2:00). Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'PARTICULARLY IN THE HEARTLAND' You can almost feel the self-congratulation in the hearts and minds of the writers and performers of this surrealist ensemble piece as they try to understand how the Red states think and live. The result? A well-intentioned mess of emoting over the current political divides (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101). (Bellafante) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'CONFIDENCE, WOMEN!' Robert Cucuzza's period piece about swindlers, liars and prostitutes is surprisingly sedate (1:30). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, www.acmeactinglab.com; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'REPUBLIC OF DREAMS' A homage to Bruno Schulz that consists of a pastiche of scenes suggested by excerpts from that profoundly surreal Polish writer's work. Parts are intriguing, but there is little coherence in the jumble of scenes to help an audience unfamiliar with the author (1:00). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) '1001 BEDS' Tim Miller's latest confessional monologue is a sweetly nostalgic walk down memory lane (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (Scott) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'A JOURNEY OF DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH' (No rating, 75 minutes) A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer through a flurry of archival curiosities. But in their struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, adopt a scattershot approach that's ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject. (Catsoulis) * 'THE CATS OF MIRIKITANI' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Japanese) Linda Hattendorf's remarkable documentary follows her growing friendship with a homeless artist from her New York City neighborhood. Born in Sacramento in 1920 and raised in Hiroshima, Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani relives his painful past with vivid paintings of internment camps and blood-red cities. When his health is threatened by the dust clouds of Sept. 11, Ms. Hattendorf moves him into her home, and what began as an interesting portrait of an outsider artist becomes a fascinating story of injustice and endurance. (Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Dargis) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich Mühe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MAXED OUT' (No rating, 87 minutes) A scattershot exposé of usurious banking practices in debt-ridden America, ''Maxed Out'' examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: it's obscenely profitable. (Stephen Holden) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'THE NAMESAKE' (PG-13, 122 minutes) Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now. (Holden) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'ROCK BOTTOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) This graphic documentary by Jay Corcoran is a strong, scary examination of the crystal methedrine epidemic among gay men in New York. (Holden) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE ULTIMATE GIFT' (PG, 114 minutes) This hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox's new religion-oriented label, Fox Faith, follows a trust fund baby (Drew Fuller) as he learns to be a better, poorer person. And while it's always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of Christian audiences isn't the best way to get them into the multiplex. (Catsoulis) 'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series 'CENTERED IN THE STORM': WORKS BY MASTER FILMMAKER TIAN ZHUANGZHUANG (Today through Tuesday) The main attraction of this mini-retrospective of one of China's most eclectic and interesting filmmakers is ''The Go Master,'' Mr. Tian's most recent film and the story of a young Chinese man who rises through the ranks of Japan's championship Go players while World War II rages offscreen. Also screening: ''The Blue Kite,'' a 1993 feature about a family torn apart by the excesses of Maoism (it earned Mr. Tian a five-year ban from feature filmmaking), and the serenely classical ''Springtime in a Small Town'' (2002), this director's illuminating remake of a 1948 Chinese feature by Fei Mu. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 'PIMPS, PROSTITUTES AND PIGS': SHOHEI IMAMURA'S JAPAN (Today through Thursday) The great earthy cynic of Japanese film, Shohei Imamura, died last year, leaving a staggering volume of work. This monthlong festival includes several of his more rarely screened films, including (tonight) ''Profound Desire of the Gods'' (1968), a raucous social panorama set on a small island where technology is destroying the old way of life; ''The Pornographers'' (1966), an unlikely comedy about a man who makes pornographic movies in the hope of improving the Japanese character; and ''Intentions of Murder'' (1964)), in which a woman defies convention and takes matters into her own hands after she is raped. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) 'LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION': ARTISTS' FILMS FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow) The Whitney Museum of American Art's series of films by artists best known for their work in other mediums continues with a program enigmatically called ''Hype My Light.'' Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. Joseph Cornell's collage film ''Rose Hobart'' (1936), about that all but forgotten actress, will be shown. This 19-minute reverie was carved out of a 16-millimeter print of the 1931 Universal sound feature ''East of Borneo'' (and not from ''a classic silent,'' as the Whitney catalog asserts). It shares a double bill with the self-mythologizing of ''Pull My Daisy'' (1959), Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie's celebration of their Beat Generation pals. At 2 p.m. Buster Keaton walks through Samuel Beckett's ''Film'' (1965) (which the Whitney, paradoxically, is screening on video). It will be followed by Rebecca Horn's 1991 feature, ''Buster's Bedroom,'' about a woman so obsessed with Keaton that she checks herself into the sanitarium where he dried out in the 1930s. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; $15. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Thursday) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. This year there are 13 shows over three weeks, beginning on Thursday, and in addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) LAURIE ANDERSON (Tonight and Sunday night) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. At 7, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) Diahann Carroll (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) Her follow-up to last year's triumphant return to nightclub performance is essentially the same show she performed last year, but with a few tweaks. It's still excellent. At 8:30, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) KARAN CASEY (Monday) A former member of the Irish band Solas, Ms. Casey sets her clear voice in arrangements that mix traditional and modern instruments, maintaining the taut, quivering ornamentation of old ballad style and singing tales of love, war and murder with a gentle gravity. At 7:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000, makor.org; $20. (Jon Pareles) CHIEFTAINS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Chieftains spearheaded a revival of Irish traditional music, playing only the oldest instruments: fiddle, harp, wooden flute, uilleann pipes, bodhran, tin whistle. Then they decided that Irish tradition wasn't enough and started to look further afield: to Spain, to China, to rock. But they have been returning to their Irish core, and there's a great ensemble behind the shtick. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $22 to $68. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $85. (Pareles) DAUGHTRY (Monday) Like Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry -- who drops his first name when performing with a band -- is a sign of why ''American Idol'' doesn't work perfectly: he reached only as high as No. 4 last season, but his album, ''Daughtry'' (RCA), with arena-size, fist-pumping rock songs, has become one of the biggest and steadiest sellers of the year. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) DECEMBERISTS (Wednesday and Thursday) He might not exactly have a lot of competition, but Colin Meloy, the songwriter and strategist of this band from Portland, Ore., can set old Irish epics and alliterative fables about Dickensian chimney sweeps to progressive folk-rock like nobody else. Opening the show is My Brightest Diamond, led by Shara Worden, who in a slippery and dexterous voice spins fantasies that leap in scale from music boxes to heavenly bodies. At 8 p.m., Landmark Loew's Jersey Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City, (866) 468-7619, loewsjersey.org; $27.50 to $30. (Sisario) THE DOUBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Something is always intriguingly askew in the songs of this local band: jagged guitars, David Greenhill's neurotic sing-speak vocals, the asymmetric gurglings of its Vox Continental organ. But the oblique lines come together in unexpected and sometimes hauntingly beautiful ways. With Mike Wexler tonight, and the Japanese Beetles and Crystal Stilts tomorrow. At 8, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $8. (Sisario) EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Tuesday) The epic instrumentals by this band from Austin, Tex., begin in peace, with single notes twinkling amid darkness, and gradually build to turbulent vortexes of noise. Borrowing a few tricks from Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky keeps the pace majestic and the vistas cinematic, and takes its time. With the Paper Chase and Eluvium. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) RUTHIE FOSTER (Wednesday and Thursday) A veteran of the acoustic folk circuit, this Texas singer and guitarist has turned to the sound of cozy 1960s soul on her new album, ''The Phenomenal Ruthie Foster'' (Blue Corn Music). That suits her friendly alto fine, but her power and sass come through better in bare, bluesy songs, like her version of Son House's boiling ''Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Amy Helm of Ollabelle, at the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. Thursday at 10 p.m., with Lucy Wainwright Roche, at Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario) Fujiya & Miyagi (Sunday through Tuesday) This British trio, which derives part of its name from ''The Karate Kid'' -- ''We are only pretending to be Japanese,'' goes one lyric -- plays bubbly, perpetual-motion figures of guitar and keyboard, and never breaks a sweat. Its sound has been heard plenty of times before, from '90s groups like Stereolab and from earlier German experimentalists, but it's too fun and innocuous to ever tire of. Sunday at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. Monday at 9 p.m., McIntosh Student Center, Barnard College, Broadway at 117th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-6538, wbar.org; $5. (Sisario) * GILBERTO GIL (Tuesday) This pillar of Brazilian music, a creator of the postmodern Tropicália style in the '60s and now his country's minister of culture, makes a rare appearance at Carnegie Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Sisario) * LEVON HELM (Tonight and tomorrow night) After a hiatus for recovery from throat cancer, Mr. Helm, the former drummer of the Band and the singer of hits like ''The Weight,'' has returned with a raspier but still powerfully expressive voice. These shows have an unusual setting: the Beacon Theater. Lately Mr. Helm has preferred to play for small groups at his home studio in Woodstock, N.Y. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) INDIGO GIRLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Kaki King. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $40. (Pareles) KODO (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Japanese drum troupe doesn't need microphones for some of its music: taiko ritual pieces made to be heard for miles, pounded on drums as large as the people who play them. From that foundation, the group has also fused its music with rhythms from India, Brazil and elsewhere. Tonight, as part of its 25th-anniversary tour, Kodo members play a rare small-scale show at Joe's Pub with Kaoru Watanabe, a former member now based in New York. At 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $35; $60 for both shows. Tomorrow night at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Pareles) * LAMB OF GOD (Thursday) Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and without any irony or sarcasm calls its style ''pure American metal.'' With Trivium, Machine Gun and Gojira. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) SUSAN McKEOWN (Today) A regular on the Irish music scene of New York, Ms. McKeown, who was born in Dublin, performs traditional music and contemporary songs about the immigrant experience in a strong, forthright voice. At 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) MEW (Thursday) This Danish band straddles the arty and sentimental extremes of Radiohead, indulging in dense guitar textures but leaving room for crying, emotive vocals. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) Jane Monheit (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The beauty of her sultry voice performing bossa nova ballads triumphs over liabilities that include obvious shyness and rushed, perfunctory patter. At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight, tomorrow and Thursday, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 cover at tables, $55 at the bar. (Holden) * WILLIE NELSON, MERLE HAGGARD AND RAY PRICE (Thursday) On their new album, ''The Last of the Breed'' (Lost Highway), these mellow titans of country music lean back and savor every sweet note of classic songs by Hank Williams, Kris Kristofferson and others, recreating with pedal steel guitars and harmonies by the Jordanaires the sound of a Nashville recording studio, about 1960. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $46.50 to $81.50. (Sisario) * OOIOO (Tuesday) O.K., maybe this offshoot of the Japanese band the Boredoms is not quite as cartoonishly antic as that group, which for nearly two decades has been one of the planet's most unpredictable musical forces. But the tribal drums, electronic squeaks and jazz-fusion guitar and trumpet on OOIOO's new album, ''Taiga'' (Thrill Jockey), come pretty close. Also on the bill is I.U.D., featuring Lizzie Bougatsos of the experimental New York band Gang Gang Dance. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * POGUES (Tomorrow) The band that made traditional Irish music seem like punk rock -- and vice versa -- plays the last of three shows for what Guinness calls the ''St. Patrick's Day season.'' Last year the Pogues played their first shows in New York in 15 years with Shane MacGowan, their Dionysian former singer, and Mr. MacGowan is back on board again. With the Tossers. At 8 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Wednesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite '70s rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's repertory includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Krystle Warren. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) RALPH STANLEY (Sunday) Mr. Stanley's stark, unflinching ''O Death'' leaped out of the soundtrack of ''O Brother, Where Are Thou?'' and introduced a few million new listeners to a gripping, venerable singer whose songs about sin, temptation and salvation are cornerstones of country music. Leading his own band, Mr. Stanley is more avuncular than apocalyptic, but his songs still have eerie moments. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $33 at the door. (Pareles) Suishou no Fune (Tuesday) This Tokyo group, whose name means crystal ship, carries on a Japanese underground rocktradition of immersion in both tranquil, spooky psychedelia and rumbling sonic chaos. Like Fushitsusha, its earliest ancestor, Suishou no Fune is transcendent in either extreme. At 8 p.m., with Madeline and Dynamite Arrows, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario) * JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, PINK (Wednesday) Like Michael Jackson or Prince, Justin Timberlake is the kind of pop star who makes it all look easy. But even more endearing, the guy can truly make fun of himself: his brilliant ''Saturday Night Live'' skit with Andy Samberg, bleeped on television but uncensored on the Internet, was the equivalent of a chummy high-five with his audience. Opening the show is Pink, the spark plug who once bragged of getting the party started and now ridicules ''stupid girls'' who torture themselves for men. At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $53 to $151. (Sisario) YOUNG KNIVES (Tuesday and Thursday) The Young Knives, from the tiny English town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, are not the first to pick up Gang of Four's legacy of jagged guitars, uptight punk-funk and lyrics about the angry boredom of the workaday life, but on ''Voices of Animals and Men'' (Transgressive/Ryko), the band does it with worthy verve and wit. Tuesday at 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Thursday at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

Opera 'DIE ÄEGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Monday) Not your everyday Richard Strauss opera has a new production at the Metropolitan Opera, and performances continue on Monday. Deborah Voigt stars in the title role, and Fabio Luisi conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'ANDREA CHENIER' (Thursday) Set in the 18th century but very much a product of the 19th, Giordano's Italian drama of the French Revolution returns to the Met with a cast that is able to sing very, very loudly, if not always especially elegantly or with particular Italian flair: Violeta Urmana, Ben Heppner and Mark Delavan. Marco Armiliato, emerging as a solid presence in the pit, conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's opera, which was introduced in November and returned on Wednesday night, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. The baritone Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. The tenor Juan Diego Flórez, sounding fresher than in the fall, could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva. The captivating mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The virile bass-baritone John Relyea makes the wily Don Baisilio seem delightfully dangerous. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $120 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $15 to $65 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Thursday) New York City Opera's last foray into the little-known world of Rossini's serious operas was successful enough that the company is going back for more, with the same two leads featured in ''Ermione'' a few seasons ago. Alexandrina Pendatchanska is an intense, committed soprano; Barry Banks, the tenor, is emerging as someone to watch. Chas Rader-Shieber, the director, has brought an antic touch to his two previous outings with the company, ''Flavio'' (which returns this spring) and ''Orlando.'' George Manahan conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $120. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tomorrow) Gounod's lush score is back at the Met in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 remaining.

At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $115. (Holland) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) At City Opera, Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic, Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King and Mark Jacoby as Major General Stanley. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday and Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Kozinn) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight and Tuesday) For its revival of Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover. And the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft is Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Tommasini) Classical Music ALARM WILL SOUND (Sunday) This ensemble of young new-music specialists makes a point of ignoring genre barriers. Included in this retrospective are the group's own arrangements of electronica by Aphex Twin, as well as pieces by several of the ensemble's performers. In this context, John Adams (represented by ''Scratchband'') may seem the most conservative composer on the program, and how often does that happen? At 3 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Kozinn) DIANA DAMRAU (Wednesday) This fine German coloratura soprano, in town for the Met's new production of ''Die Äegyptische Helena,'' takes time out to make her New York recital debut with a program of French-language songs by Liszt and Barber, songs (sung in English) by Rachmaninoff, Berg's ''Seven Early Songs,'' Zemlinsky's ''Gesänge'' (Op. 6) and, of course, songs by Strauss. Stephan Matthias Lademann is the accompanist. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $34. (Midgette) * INGRID FLITER (Wednesday) The career of this Argentine pianist has taken off since winning the 2006 Gilmore Artist Award and its $300,000 prize. Ms. Fliter makes her New York recital debut with a program including Beethoven's C minor Variations (WoO 80); Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 959); and Chopin's Nocturne in D flat (Op. 27, No. 2), ''Barcarolle'' (Op. 60), Ballade in F minor (Op. 52) and Three Mazurkas (Op. 59). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $40. (Vivien Schweitzer) ANDREA GRUBER and RUSSELL THOMAS (Sunday) The wood-paneled auditorium at the Morgan Library & Museum is a warm, resonant space, and it should resound aplenty with the voice of Andrea Gruber, the opera soprano, who will appear in recital with Russell Thomas, a young tenor, under the aegis of the George London Foundation, which pairs established singers with rising ones. The program should contain at least a whiff of opera: it includes music by Beethoven, Duparc, Ponchielli, Puccini and Verdi. Ken Noda is the accompanist. At 4 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 877-6347, themorgan.org; $45.

(Dunning) URBAN BALLET THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) Ballet meets break-dancing in choreography by the company's director, Daniel Catanach, complete with a live D.J., on a program with pieces by Andres Gonzalez and Randy Luna. (Through March 24.) Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, henrystreet.org/arts; $15. (Dunning) * ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Young's ''Snow White'' departs from the traditional to explore (what else?) the psychosexual tensions between Snow White, her Evil Stepmother (could they be an item?) and her Prince, which run rampant in claustrophobic interiors and kitschy woodlands. (Through March 24.) All performances at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through April 29. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so preposterously exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: 'JEFF WALL,' through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea Michael Waugh: 'Lead me astray' Mr. Waugh's work is about close reading. Several large drawings of 19th-century landscapes are composed of handwritten phrases, cut and pasted in nonsensical order, from American presidential inaugural speeches. A drawing of the Spanish colonial explorer Cabeza de Vaca, who landed in Florida, is installed in a room plastered with promotional materials from a different colonialist enterprise, the last Art Basel/Miami fair. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722; through March 24. (Cotter) Last Chance * Cathy Begien The reason to see this first solo show by the San Francisco filmmaker Cathy Begien is an ingenious, surprisingly intense short video called ''Black Out.'' In it the blindfolded artist delivers an episodic account of a bad-trip, club-hopping night on the town, as friends pop into the frame from the side to hand her drinks and cigarettes and act out parts of the story. When Ms. Begien breaks down toward the end of the film, it's hard to tell whether she's laughing or crying. Both responses make sense. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * ALINE KOMINSKY CRUMB: 'NEED MORE LOVE' On the occasion of her wonderfully forthright, lavishly illustrated book of the same title, one of the premier cartoonists of her generation and a force in the development of the confessional graphic novel lets quite a bit of it all hang out in paintings, drawings and, best of all, comic strips dating from 1973 to the present. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes tomorrow. (Smith) EVA AND FRACO MATTES: '13 MOST BEAUTIFUL AVATARS' This artistic duo, best known for media hacking and culture jamming, has turned to digital canvas portraits of avatars -- digital surrogates -- from the online virtual world Second Life. With their flat colors, slightly blocky features and assertive hair, these images have a jaded artifice worthy of ''Blade Runner,'' but are also eerily effective as paintings. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self-conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourage you to stay tuned. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: TRANSFER DRAWINGS FROM THE 1960S This is the first exhibition devoted to the artist's large transfer drawings of the 1960s, which function less as works of art than as refined filtering systems. Their hazy, flickering surfaces mix bits of history (the space race, the civil rights movement, the cold war) with eruptions of weirdly rotelike graphic finesse -- the windshield-wiper strokes with which Rauschenberg brought his images to the surface. Extraordinarily beautiful and hauntingly multifarious, these works show us art, art history and the very times we live in taking shape. Jonathan O'Hara Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-3533; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics' Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) * 'What F Word?' The ''F word'' in question for this group is feminism, though others come under its purview. The work spans decades, from an apt updating of a Flemish Madonna and child by the estimable and too long overlooked Anita Steckel, to very recent art by Dana Frankfort, Jane Hammond and Shay Nowick. In a brand-new piece, Elaine Reichek brings Ezra Pound into the picture. Ulrike Muller pays tribute to Mina Loy. Patricia Cronin contributes an image of a tomb sculpture she designed, depicting herself and her lover, the artist Deborah Kass (also in the show), embracing on a bed. Cynthia Broan Gallery, 546 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 760-0809, cynthiabroan.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",4fd2b0b08eb7c8105d8a023a,15425

New Yorks New Landmarks,2008-03-19,"Webster Hall, a 19th-century East Village assembly space where F. Scott Fitzgerald once reveled and Emma Goldman urged social change, was one of several buildings designated historic landmarks on Monday by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Designed by Charles Rentz and built in 1886, with an annex added in 1992, Webster Hall, a Renaissance Revival structure at 119-125 East 11th Street, is clad in red Philadelphia pressed brick with brownstone trim and red terra-cotta ornamentation. (A mansard roof was destroyed in the 1930s.) The hall, seen above in the 1910s, became famous for masquerade balls after a 1913 fund-raiser for the socialist magazine The Masses and became a hub not only for Village bohemians but also for gay men and lesbians. The artists Charles Demuth, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray used the hall, as did F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and political and labor leaders like Goldman, Samuel Gompers, Margaret Sanger and Dorothy Day. The Progressive Labor Party was established there in 1887, and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1914. In the 1950s and ’60s, RCA Victor operated a studio there, where Arthur Rubinstein, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marian Anderson and many others recorded. Webster Hall later became a rock club. Three other East Village structures also received landmark designation: the 11th Street Public Bath, at 539 East 11th Street, a Beaux-Arts structure designed by Arnold W. Brunner and completed in 1906; the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Anshe Ungarn, at 242 East Seventh Street, a Beaux Arts synagogue built in 1908 for a congregation of Hungarian Jews; and the Elizabeth Home for Girls, at 307 East 12th Street, a High Victorian Gothic brick and sandstone structure built in 1892 for use by the Children’s Aid Society.",547f401e7988107cec11c963,295
The Listings,2008-05-09,"'JAZZ GIANTS: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF HERMAN LEONARD' There have been many great jazz photographers but none more accomplished than Herman Leonard. In a celebrated career that began in the late 1940s, Mr. Leonard, now in his mid-80s, is responsible for some of the music's defining images. His geometrically balanced musician portraits in particular, with their suggestions of cool composure, have long captured what seemed like the essence of jazz, at least in its golden age. Try to conjure the drummer Art Blakey in the mind's eye, and you might well summon him as captured in a photograph by Mr. Herman from 1958: head tilted back, mouth agape, arms in mid-flail. Or consider Dexter Gordon, whose most famous portrait, above, perfectly distills his air of roguish charm and watchful ease. Or think of Lester Young, whom Mr. Leonard once implied by photographing only his personal effects: tenor saxophone case, porkpie hat and a lighted cigarette resting on the lip of an empty soda bottle. It's an ingenious still life and a shrewd act of portraiture in absentia.",4fd27a368eb7c8105d83e1d3,352

Dick of Armonk, NY, passed away early Sunday morning (April 19, 2009) at Northern Westchester Hospital after a protracted illness. Born May 14, 1924, in New Haven, CT, to Morris and Beatrice, he graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1945; A.M., 1951); Yale Law School (LL.B., 1950); Harvard University (Ph.D., 1956). Dick studied Japanese while serving his country in WWII. While working on his doctoral degree in Japan, he became one of a handful of foreign lawyers ever admitted to the Japanese Bar, and was admitted to the Korean Bar as well. He practiced law in Tokyo for more than 35 years as a founding partner of what was then the largest and most well-known firm in Japan, Anderson Mori & Rabinowitz. He returned to the United States in 1991, teaching at Harvard and Yale Law Schools. From 1995 until his death, he was Of Counsel to Tozai Sogo Law Office, also of Tokyo, Japan. A lover of Jazz since his early days at University, Dick wept when listening to Billie Holiday, and had great reverence for Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, who, as he explained, got him through many late night study sessions. A high school ice hockey goalie, his devotion to the sport only intensified with age. It was not uncommon for him to schedule his work and naps around what game was on, and was loyal to the game, not a team.

"Paid Notice: Deaths  Rabinowitz, Richard W.",2009-04-26,"<!-- RICHARD W. RABINOWITZ -->RABINOWITZ--Richard W. ""Dick"", in his 85th year. Dick of Armonk, NY, passed away early Sunday morning (April 19, 2009) at Northern Westchester Hospital after a protracted illness. Born May 14, 1924, in New Haven, CT, to Morris and Beatrice, he graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1945; A.M., 1951); Yale Law School (LL.B., 1950); Harvard University (Ph.D., 1956). Dick studied Japanese while serving his country in WWII. While working on his doctoral degree in Japan, he became one of a handful of foreign lawyers ever admitted to the Japanese Bar, and was admitted to the Korean Bar as well. He practiced law in Tokyo for more than 35 years as a founding partner of what was then the largest and most well-known firm in Japan, Anderson Mori & Rabinowitz. He returned to the United States in 1991, teaching at Harvard and Yale Law Schools. From 1995 until his death, he was Of Counsel to Tozai Sogo Law Office, also of Tokyo, Japan. A lover of Jazz since his early days at University, Dick wept when listening to Billie Holiday, and had great reverence for Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, who, as he explained, got him through many late night study sessions. A high school ice hockey goalie, his devotion to the sport only intensified with age. It was not uncommon for him to schedule his work and naps around what game was on, and was loyal to the game, not a team. Dick is survived by his wife of 57 years, Janice Hope Rabinowitz (Rosenbaum), and their three children, Ann Akiko Rabinowitz Dantzig (Armonk, NY) and her longtime partner John Diacnois, John Makoto Rabinowitz (Benicia, CA) and his wife Loan, Anthony Carl Rabinowitz (South Lake Tahoe, CA) and his wife Lisa, two granddaughters Natasha Chieko and Alexia Haruko Dantzig, and John's children Ari and Alix Diaconis Contributions in Dick's memory may be made in the United States to the Ken Hamilton Caregivers Center, Northern Westchester Hospital Center, 400 East Main Street, Mt.

"For Nixon, All That Jazz",2010-01-31,"IN April 1969, three months after his inauguration, President Richard Nixon hosted a party at the White House to celebrate Duke Ellington's 70th birthday and award the Duke the Medal of Honor. Great American jazz figures were there. Musicians played Ellington songs arranged by Gerry Mulligan. Joe Williams and Mary Mayo sang. Ellington danced with Rose Mary Woods. After dinner, the president had a nightcap with the pianist Earl Hines. It was in many other ways a very good year for President Nixon. He called to congratulate the Apollo 11 astronauts on their moon landing. He initiated a huge expansion of the National Endowment for the Arts and began the processes that led to the desegregation of public schools in the South and a historic reform of the government's policy toward American Indians. He announced the ''Nixon doctrine,'' providing aid -- but not military forces -- to our anticommunist Asian allies. He signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.",4fd2929b8eb7c8105d86c29c,469

Corrections,2010-05-14,"An obituary in some editions on Monday about the singer and actress Lena Horne included a number of errors. Nina Mae McKinney, not Ms. Horne, was the first black performer signed to a long-term contract by a major Hollywood studio. (Ms. McKinney signed a five-year contract with MGM in 1929, more than a decade before Ms. Horne joined the same studio.) Ms. Horne's son, Teddy, died in 1970, not 1971. And besides her daughter, Gail Lumet Buckley, Ms. Horne is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. At the time Ms. Horne was hired by the Cotton Club in Harlem, in 1933, Duke Ellington was no longer performing there. The 1951 movie version of the musical ''Show Boat'' -- in which Ms. Horne had wanted to be cast -- was the third film version, not the second.

Giant Steps,2010-01-31,"Influential artists sometimes click in the public consciousness only after the rise of the movements they have influenced. A school of creative work emerges -- seemingly spontaneously, its origins obscure at first. Then, with attention to the artists in that school comes recognition of their influences, their antecedents and their mentors. After Pollock, de Kooning and their peers in postwar American art established Abstract Expressionism, the precursory importance of prewar iconoclasts like Kandinsky became clear. After the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash blurted forth punk rock in the 1970s, a rude vision became apparent in the noise of '60s garage bands like the Seeds. A new movement in jazz has surfaced over the past few years -- a wave of highly expressive music more concerned with emotion than with craft or virtuosity; a genre-blind music that casually mingles strains of pop, classical and folk musics from many cultures; an informal, elastic music unyielding to rigid conceptions of what jazz is supposed to be. It's fair to call it ''post-Marsalis,'' in that it leaves behind the defensive, canon-oriented musical conservatism of '90s jazz (as both Branford and Wynton Marsalis themselves have done in their best work of the past decade).

'Harlem of South' Revived in Richmond,2011-10-30,"A T its zenith in the early 20th century, Jackson Ward, in Richmond, Va., was a thriving, multicultural quarter known as the Harlem of the South, with the likes of Duke Ellington and the native son Bill Robinson, known as Bojangles, headlining at the Hippodrome Theater. In the 1950s, the construction of Interstate 95 split the neighborhood, and Jackson Ward fell into decline. Vacant storefronts still blemish some of the historic district's 40 square blocks, but thanks to plucky restaurateurs, gallery owners and shopkeepers, there's a scent of promise mingling with the magnolias. So far it's more of a daytime and early evening scene -- but night life is coming back too: the long-empty Hippodrome has been restored and is scheduled to reopen in November, combined with a bistro and speakeasy-type bar. Italianate houses with cast-iron porches, the Black History Museum and the fascinating museum dedicated to the entrepreneur Maggie L. Walker are further reasons to stroll these brick sidewalks.

Jazz at Lincoln Center Plans Mini-Festivals,2012-03-06,"The highlights of Jazz at Lincoln Center's 2012-13 programming season will include six mini-festivals dedicated to major jazz figures, styles and institutions of the past and present, the organization said. The festivals will focus on John Coltrane; Duke Ellington; Chick Corea; Blue Note records; the idea of the ''cool,'' as traced through Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis and the Modern Jazz Quartet; and the bebop of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Each will include large-cast concerts in the Rose Theater and smaller ensembles in the Allen Room. Other events include ''My Audio Biography,'' a retrospective concert by Bobby McFerrin with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (Sept. 13 to 15); a collaboration between the Bad Plus and the guitarist Bill Frisell (April 12 and 13, 2013); and a performance of ''Blood on the Fields,'' the 1994 oratorio written by Wynton Marsalis, the organization's artistic director (Feb. 21 to 23, 2013).

'Cotton Club' Redux,2012-07-17,"Last year's Encores! production of ''Cotton Club Parade,'' a musical revue about the celebrated Harlem nightclub during the Duke Ellington years, will return for a limited run from Nov. 14-18 at City Center, the show's producers announced on Monday. Most of the cast will return for the production, which again will be directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle (''Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway'') and will have music direction by Wynton Marsalis, Jazz at Lincoln Center's artistic director. Music will be provided by the Jazz at Lincoln Center All Stars, directed by Daryl Waters. Conceived by Jack Viertel, the song-and-dance show features jazz, blues and swing standards of the 1920s and '30s written by several composers, including Jimmy McHugh and the lyricist Dorothy Fields (''I Can't Give You Anything But Love''), Harold Arlen (''Stormy Weather,'' ''I've Got the World on a String''), and Duke Ellington (''Rockin' in Rhythm,'' ''Cotton Club Stomp''). The show received mostly positive reviews when it ran for six performances last November. Stephen Holden, in his review for The Times, called it a ''thrilling 90-minute celebration'' that ''made period jazz come to life with a focused intensity and rhythmic savvy.''",500dcb071c22dfde670b217b,281

"Paid Notice: Deaths  LANIN, MIKE ",2014-06-01,"<!-- MIKE  LANIN -->LANIN--Mike. President of Howard Lanin Productions passed away in New York on April 14, 2014 at age 90. In 1952 Mike hired a 22-year old conductor for a nationwide Gershwin concert tour that ran for two seasons (1952-54) and played in 170 cities. His name: Lorin Maazel. It was the only orchestra in history dedicated exclusively to the music of one composer. Mike pursued his interest in George Gershwin in collaboration with Michael Feinstein. Mike, a well-known producer of shows for large corporations (IBM, Coca Cola, CBS, AT&T) hired star performers such as Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Diahann Carroll, Leslie Huggams, Lena Horne, Bob Hope, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Bolger, Doc Severinsen and Bill Cosby among others. Memorable productions Mike presented include The Royal Danish Ballet in its US debut and The Conservatory Without Walls, a glittering event in honor of the country's greatest Afro-American musicians which launched the Duke Ellington Fellowship Fund at Yale University. Mike also served on the board of The Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance. Mike Lanin was born in Philadelphia on March, 8, 1924, the son of the band leader Howard Lanin and the nephew of Lester Lanin, the internationally known society band leader. During World War II he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps. At that time he discovered a young and talented pianist, still unknown, Bobby Short. They became friends for the rest of their lives. Mike was a graduate of Yale University where he was an imaginative caricaturist for the Yale Record. He is also remembered for his fond portrayal of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Mike was an elegant man both in appearance and in spirit. He was always courteous, soft spoken, never one to boast of his many achievements and of his friendships with famous artists. He was a loyal friend, a witty but considerate companion with a dry sense of humor. He was an entertaining guest. Mike has been called ""the dean of entertainment who pioneered the theme party, the pops concert, the anniversary revue and the multimedia production."" He was an avid reader and traveler. He kept homes in New York and Paris. He is survived by his wife of 45 years, the love of his life, Yvonne Constant-Lanin, a performer herself and a frequent guest (45 times) on the Johnny Carson Show. It was always a pleasure to see how much Mike enjoyed his wife's performances. He was proud of her interpretations of French and American songs. At her recitals he would greet friends with a radiant smile. He was also proud of Yvonne having been named ""Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres"", an important French cultural award. Other immediate survivors include his sister, Suzanne Lande, his adopted daughter Kristina Stufano from a previous marriage, his stepson, Gerard Pinguet and numerous grandchildren.<br><br>
